   - This is the ONLY authoritative source for the Planning is Prompting entry point
   - Do NOT proceed without reading this document in full
   - The canonical workflow contains: Philosophy explanation, visual flow diagram, decision matrix, and guidance to appropriate next steps

3. **MUST execute the complete entry point workflow**:

## Notes

This slash command is a **reference wrapper** that reads the canonical workflow document on every invocation. This ensures:
- Always up-to-date implementation when canonical doc is improved
- Single source of truth for the planning system entry point
- Demonstrates the workflow pattern for other projects
- This file serves as a working example for other repos
