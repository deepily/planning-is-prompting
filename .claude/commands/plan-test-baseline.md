## Instructions to Claude

**On every invocation of this command:**

1. **MUST use the following project-specific configuration**:
   - **[SHORT_PROJECT_PREFIX]**: [PLAN]
   - **Project Name**: Planning is Prompting
   - **Working Directory**: /mnt/DATA01/include/www.deepily.ai/projects/planning-is-prompting
   - **Paths**:
     - Logs Directory: tests/results/logs
     - Reports Directory: tests/results/reports
   - **Test Types**: smoke (documentation validation only)
   - **Test Scripts**: Simple validation script (validates docs exist and are readable)
   - **Health Checks**: None required (no server/service dependencies)
   - **Environment**: No special environment variables needed
   - Do NOT proceed without these parameters

2. **MUST read the canonical workflow document**:
   - Location: planning-is-prompting â†’ workflow/testing-baseline.md
   - This is the ONLY authoritative source for ALL baseline testing steps
   - Do NOT proceed without reading this document in full

3. **MUST execute the complete baseline testing workflow**:
   - Execute ALL steps exactly as described in the canonical workflow document
   - Do NOT skip any steps (including TodoWrite tracking, notifications, or test execution)
   - Do NOT substitute a shortened or summarized version
   - Follow the workflow exactly as documented using the configuration parameters from Step 1
   - For this documentation project, "smoke tests" means: verify workflow documents exist and are readable, check referenced paths are valid, validate markdown formatting, ensure cross-references work
