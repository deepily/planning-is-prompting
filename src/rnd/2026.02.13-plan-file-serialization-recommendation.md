# Plan File Serialization: Research & Recommendation

**Date**: 2026.02.13
**Status**: Implemented
**Deliverables**: Canonical workflow, global skill, CLAUDE.md directive

---

## Executive Summary

Claude Code's plan file naming convention (`[adjective]-[gerund]-[noun].md`) produces semantically meaningless filenames. After 31 days of usage, 169 plan files have accumulated in `~/.claude/plans/` with zero searchability. This document presents the research data and recommends formalizing an existing ad-hoc serialization pattern.

## Research Data

### File Inventory (2026.02.13)

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Total plan files | 169 |
| Total directory size | 1.6 MB |
| Days of usage sampled | 31 |
| Daily creation rate | ~5.4 files/day |
| Projected monthly volume | ~162 files |
| Projected yearly volume | ~1,971 files |

### Naming Convention Breakdown

The naming scheme uses three fixed word categories:

| Position | Category | Sample Words (from 169 files) |
|----------|----------|-------------------------------|
| 1st | Adjective | abstract, adaptive, agile, atomic, breezy, cached, compiled, composed, compressed, crystalline, curious, dazzling, distributed, dreamy, drifting, dynamic, eager, elegant, encapsulated, expressive, fancy, federated, fluttering, foamy, functional, generic, gleaming, glimmering, golden |
| 2nd | Gerund | beaming, bouncing, bubbling, chasing, conjuring, crunching, cuddling, dazzling, drifting, exploring, finding, fluttering, foraging, gathering, growing, hugging, jumping, knitting, launching, mapping, marinating, moseying, popping, prancing, purring, roaming, scribbling, seeking, skipping, sleeping, snuggling, sparking, squishing, tinkering, toasting, whistling, wiggling, zooming |
| 3rd | Noun | abelson, backus, balloon, beacon, beaver, canyon, cocke, ember, finch, fox, gem, grove, hamming, harp, hickey, hollerith, hummingbird, kahan, kazoo, lagoon, lemur, lynx, mist, mountain, narwhal, nova, papert, parnas, pearl, pebble, pixel, pretzel, puzzle, robin, storm, stroustrup, sutherland, tarjan, trinket, wave, widget, wolf, wreath |

**Key finding**: ~40% of nouns are CS pioneer surnames (abelson, backus, hamming, hollerith, kahan, papert, parnas, stroustrup, sutherland, tarjan, cocke, hickey). While charming, these carry no information about plan content.

### Searchability Gap Evidence

| Random Filename | Actual Plan Content | Findable? |
|----------------|---------------------|-----------|
| `dreamy-wiggling-pretzel.md` | Runtime argument whitelist expeditor | No |
| `transient-bouncing-widget.md` | Unified smoke test framework verification | No |
| `gleaming-gathering-gem.md` | Notification API reference documentation | No |
| `compiled-popping-hamming.md` | Unknown without reading file | No |
| `elegant-cuddling-wave.md` | Unknown without reading file | No |
| `dynamic-sleeping-hummingbird.md` | Unknown without reading file | No |

**To find a specific plan**: Must `grep` inside every file or read them sequentially. At 169 files and growing, this is O(n) per search.

### Existing Ad-Hoc Serialization

Evidence of organic serialization already occurring in projects:

| Project | Source (Claude Plans) | Destination (R&D) |
|---------|----------------------|-------------------|
| planning-is-prompting | Unknown random name | `src/rnd/2026.01.05-cosa-voice-mcp-migration-plan.md` |
| planning-is-prompting | Unknown random name | `src/rnd/2025.12.31-skills-creation-tutorial.md` |
| planning-is-prompting | Unknown random name | `src/rnd/2025.10.11-testing-workflows-abstraction.md` |

One plan file contained an explicit "Step 0: Archive This Plan to R&D" section, confirming the user recognized the need independently.

## Recommendation

Formalize the ad-hoc serialization pattern as a cross-project behavioral directive:

1. **CLAUDE.md section** (~20 lines): Brief mandate with example and references
2. **Global skill** (`~/.claude/skills/plan-serialization/SKILL.md`): Trigger-activated guidance
3. **Canonical workflow** (`workflow/plan-serialization.md`): Full rationale, patterns, decision criteria

### Decision Criteria (Condensed)

```
Serialize if: >1KB AND (architectural OR >30min development OR needs future recall)
Skip if: <1KB OR abandoned OR trivial fix
```

### Naming Format

```
yyyy.mm.dd-descriptive-slug.md  (3-6 hyphenated words capturing the plan's SUBJECT)
```
