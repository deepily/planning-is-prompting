# Claude Code skills directories: A complete guide to architecture, Python integration, and implementation

Claude Code skills represent a powerful extensibility system announced in October 2025 that allows developers to package reusable instructions, scripts, and resources into modular directories. **Skills operate through a progressive disclosure mechanism** where only skill metadata (~100 tokens) loads at startup, with full content (~5k tokens) expanding into context only when Claude determines a skill is relevant. This architecture enables efficient scaling to hundreds of skills without bloating the system prompt.

## Skills follow a three-tier discovery hierarchy

Skills directories are organized across three locations, each serving different scoping needs. **Personal skills** live at `~/.claude/skills/` and apply across all projects for an individual developer—ideal for personal workflows and experimental skills. **Project skills** reside in `.claude/skills/` within a repository and are version-controlled with the codebase, making them perfect for team workflows and project-specific expertise. **Plugin skills** are distributed through the plugin marketplace and installed via commands like `/plugin install`.

When skill names conflict, the system applies a priority hierarchy: Enterprise (admin-provisioned) takes precedence, followed by Personal, then Project, and finally Plugin skills.

The required directory structure for any skill is straightforward:

```
skill-name/
├── SKILL.md              # Required - main instructions
├── references/           # Optional documentation
├── scripts/              # Optional executable code
│   └── helper.py
└── assets/               # Optional templates, icons, fonts
```

Every SKILL.md file must begin with YAML frontmatter containing two required fields: `name` (max **64 characters**, lowercase letters, numbers, and hyphens only) and `description` (max **1024 characters**, critical for Claude's discovery logic). An optional `allowed-tools` field can restrict which tools Claude may use when executing the skill.

## Python scripts execute through the Bash tool without consuming context tokens

Skills can absolutely include executable Python scripts, and this represents one of their most powerful capabilities. The `scripts/` subdirectory houses Python utilities, validators, and processing code that Claude executes via its Bash tool. **Scripts run without loading their contents into context**—Claude receives only the output, saving significant tokens for complex operations.

The execution mechanism works through a `{baseDir}` variable that automatically resolves to the skill's installation directory. When SKILL.md instructs Claude to run a script, it executes commands like:

```bash
python3 {baseDir}/scripts/extract_text.py input.pdf
```

The official Anthropic skills repository (https://github.com/anthropics/skills) demonstrates this pattern extensively—it's **83.9% Python code**. Key examples include:

The **pdf-processing** skill bundles extraction and form-filling scripts:
```
pdf-processing/
├── SKILL.md
├── FORMS.md
├── REFERENCE.md
└── scripts/
    ├── fill_form.py
    └── validate.py
```

The **mcp-builder** skill includes a Python evaluation harness at `scripts/evaluation.py` for testing MCP server implementations.

The **skill-creator** skill ships with `init_skill.py` that scaffolds new skill directories with proper structure and frontmatter templates.

Best practice is to instruct Claude to **run** scripts rather than **read** them:

```markdown
## Data Processing
Run the analysis script:
```bash
python {baseDir}/scripts/analyze.py --input "$USER_FILE"
```
Parse the generated output and present findings.
```

For Python dependencies, document requirements in SKILL.md. Claude Code can install packages from PyPI when loading skills, though API-based skill usage requires pre-installed dependencies.

## Creating custom skills requires four key steps

**Step 1: Choose the appropriate location.** For personal experimentation, create the skill in `~/.claude/skills/your-skill-name/`. For team collaboration, use `.claude/skills/your-skill-name/` so the skill commits with your repository. For distribution, bundle skills within a plugin's `skills/` directory.

**Step 2: Create the SKILL.md file with proper frontmatter:**

```yaml
---
name: pdf-processor
description: Extract text, fill forms, merge PDFs. Use when working with PDF files, when users mention PDFs, forms, or document extraction.
---

# PDF Processor

## Instructions
1. Use pdfplumber for text extraction
2. Use pypdf for form operations
3. Always validate output before returning

## Requirements
pip install pypdf pdfplumber
```

**Step 3: Add supporting resources.** Place Python scripts in `scripts/`, reference documentation in `references/`, and templates or assets in `assets/`. Keep SKILL.md under **500 lines**—split detailed content into separate reference files that Claude loads on-demand.

**Step 4: Test and iterate.** Ask Claude "What Skills are available?" to verify discovery. Test invocation by giving Claude a task matching your description. Observe whether Claude selects and uses the skill appropriately.

For discoverability, the description field is paramount. Claude evaluates incoming requests against skill descriptions to autonomously decide which skills to invoke. Write descriptions that specify both **what** the skill does and **when** to use it:

```yaml
# Effective description
description: Generate git commit messages from staged changes. Use when writing commits, reviewing diffs, or preparing code for version control.

# Ineffective description  
description: Helps with git
```

## Working examples with Python demonstrate real implementation patterns

The **obra/superpowers** repository (12.3k stars) provides battle-tested skills with Python integration:

```
superpowers/
├── skills/
│   ├── test-driven-development/SKILL.md
│   ├── systematic-debugging/SKILL.md
│   ├── subagent-driven-development/SKILL.md
│   └── writing-skills/SKILL.md
├── hooks/
└── commands/
```

Installation: `/plugin marketplace add obra/superpowers-marketplace`

The **K-Dense-AI/claude-scientific-skills** repository bundles **125+ skills** across 15 scientific domains with 54+ Python package integrations (RDKit, Scanpy, PyTorch, BioPython). Each skill references specific Python packages and includes usage examples.

A minimal working example with Python:

```
code-analyzer/
├── SKILL.md
└── scripts/
    └── analyze.py
```

**SKILL.md:**
```yaml
---
name: code-analyzer
description: Analyze code complexity metrics. Use when users ask about code quality, complexity, or maintainability scores.
---

# Code Analyzer

Run the analysis script on target files:
```bash
python {baseDir}/scripts/analyze.py "$TARGET_FILE"
```

Present findings with recommendations for improvement.
```

**scripts/analyze.py:**
```python
import sys
import ast

def analyze_file(filepath):
    with open(filepath) as f:
        tree = ast.parse(f.read())
    functions = [n for n in ast.walk(tree) if isinstance(n, ast.FunctionDef)]
    print(f"Functions: {len(functions)}")
    # Add complexity metrics...

if __name__ == "__main__":
    analyze_file(sys.argv[1])
```

## Current capabilities include tool restrictions, but API usage has limitations

**What skills can do today:**
- Bundle executable Python/Bash scripts that Claude runs via Bash tool
- Include reference documentation loaded on-demand
- Store templates and assets for output generation
- Restrict tool access via `allowed-tools` (e.g., `Read, Grep, Glob` for read-only skills)
- Be distributed through plugins and marketplaces
- Work across Claude.ai, Claude Code, and the Claude API (with Code Execution Tool beta)

**Current limitations:**
- API-based skill usage requires pre-installed dependencies (no dynamic package installation)
- Skills cannot modify Claude's core capabilities—they expand context, not tools
- Linux path issues exist in some SDK implementations (as of October 2025)
- Maximum frontmatter field lengths: 64 chars for `name`, 1024 chars for `description`
- Only `name`, `description`, `license`, `allowed-tools`, and `metadata` are valid frontmatter properties

**December 2025 updates** introduced organization-wide skill management, a Skills Directory with partner-built skills (Notion, Figma, Atlassian), and publication of Agent Skills as an open standard at agentskills.io.

## Key resources for implementation

The skills system represents a significant step toward reusable AI agent capabilities. By bundling instructions with executable code and progressive context loading, skills enable sophisticated workflows while maintaining token efficiency. For Python integration specifically, the pattern of placing scripts in a `scripts/` subdirectory and instructing Claude to execute rather than read them provides both power and efficiency.
