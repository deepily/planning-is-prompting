# planning-is-prompting
When it comes to driving agentic coding assistants like Claude Code, Gemini CLI, and OpenAI's Codex, the plan is the prompt!

## Overview

This repository is a centralized knowledge base for meta-prompting strategies and workflow configurations for agentic coding assistants. It contains reusable templates, prompts, and configurations to help you efficiently bootstrap new projects and maintain consistent workflows across your development sessions.

## Getting Started

- **[INSTALLATION-GUIDE.md](workflow/INSTALLATION-GUIDE.md)** - Centralized installation instructions for integrating workflows into your projects
- **[CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md)** - Project-specific configuration for this repository (example for other projects)
- **[.claude/commands/](.claude/commands/)** - Working examples of slash commands using reference wrapper pattern

## "Planning is Prompting" Core Workflows

**The heart of this repository** - a two-step process for planning and documenting work:

### ðŸŽ¯ Start Here
- [**p-is-p-00-start-here.md**](workflow/p-is-p-00-start-here.md) - **Entry point**: Philosophy, decision matrix, and quick start guide

### Step 1: Planning the Work (Always Required)
- [**p-is-p-01-planning-the-work.md**](workflow/p-is-p-01-planning-the-work.md) - Classify work, select pattern, break down tasks, create TodoWrite lists

### Step 2: Documenting the Implementation (Conditional)
- [**p-is-p-02-documenting-the-implementation.md**](workflow/p-is-p-02-documenting-the-implementation.md) - Create structured docs, manage token budgets, establish archival (for large projects only)

### Decision Matrix: Which Workflows Do You Need?

| Work Type | Duration | Pattern (Step 1) | Need Step 2? | Workflow Path |
|-----------|----------|------------------|--------------|---------------|
| Small feature | 1-2 weeks | Pattern 3: Feature Dev | âœ— No | â†’ **01** only â†’ history.md |
| Bug investigation | 3-5 days | Pattern 4: Investigation | âœ— No | â†’ **01** only â†’ history.md |
| Architecture design | 4-6 weeks | Pattern 5: Architecture | âœ“ Yes | â†’ **01** â†’ **02** (Pattern B) |
| Technology research | 2-3 weeks | Pattern 2: Research | âœ“ Yes | â†’ **01** â†’ **02** (Pattern C) |
| Large implementation | 8-12 weeks | Pattern 1: Multi-Phase | âœ“ Yes | â†’ **01** â†’ **02** (Pattern A) |

**Quick Rule**: Use **Step 1** only for small/simple work (< 2 weeks). Use **Step 1 + Step 2** for large/complex work (8+ weeks, multiple phases).

## Supporting Workflows

### Configuration
- [**claude-config-global.md**](workflow/claude-config-global.md) - Global Claude Code configuration template ( copy to `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` )
- [**claude-config-local.md**](workflow/claude-config-local.md) - Project-specific Claude Code configuration template ( copy to `<project>/.claude/CLAUDE.md` )

### Session Management
- [**session-start.md**](workflow/session-start.md) - Prompts for initializing sessions and loading context
- [**session-end.md**](workflow/session-end.md) - Prompts for session wrap-up, documentation, and commits

### Resource Management
- [**history-management.md**](workflow/history-management.md) - Prompts for maintaining session history and documentation

### Git & Notifications
- [**commit-management.md**](workflow/commit-management.md) - Prompts for git operations and commit workflows
- [**notification-system.md**](workflow/notification-system.md) - Prompts for using the notification system

## Usage

Each workflow file contains:
- **Purpose**: What the workflow accomplishes
- **When to use**: Appropriate timing and context
- **Key activities**: Main tasks and actions
- **Content**: The actual prompts and configurations ( to be populated )

## Example Inputs & Outputs

_To be added: Example interactions demonstrating each workflow in action_
