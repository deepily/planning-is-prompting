# Session End Ritual for Planning is Prompting Project

This document contains the comprehensive end-of-session workflow extracted from the global and local Claude.MD configuration files. This prompt should be executed when wrapping up work sessions.

## Overview

At the end of our work sessions, perform the following wrapup ritual with **[PLAN]** prefix for all notifications. Send notifications after completing each step to keep me updated on progress:

## 0) Use Notification System Throughout

**Mandate**: Keep me updated with notifications after completing each step of the end-of-session ritual.

**Global Command**: `notify-claude` (works from any directory)

**Command Format**:
```bash
notify-claude "[PLAN] MESSAGE" --type=TYPE --priority=PRIORITY
```

**When to Send Notifications**:
- After completing each major step
- Task completion milestones
- Progress updates
- When needing approval or blocked

**Priority Levels**:
- `urgent`: Errors, blocked, time-sensitive questions
- `high`: Approval requests, important status updates
- `medium`: Progress milestones
- `low`: Minor updates, todo completions, informational notices

**Types**: task, progress, alert, custom

**Example Notifications**:
```bash
notify-claude "[PLAN] ‚úÖ Session history updated" --type=progress --priority=low
notify-claude "[PLAN] Ready for commit approval" --type=task --priority=medium
notify-claude "[PLAN] üéâ Session wrap-up complete" --type=task --priority=low
```

## 0.5) History Health Check (Automated)

**Purpose**: Check history.md health BEFORE adding new session content that might push over token limit

**When**: After creating TODO list (Step 0), before updating history (Step 1)

**Process**:

1. **Invoke Health Check**:
   ```bash
   /history-management mode=check
   ```

2. **Review Health Report**:
   - Current token count
   - 7-day velocity trend
   - Forecast to breach (days until 20k/25k limit)
   - Severity status (HEALTHY, MONITOR, WARNING, CRITICAL)

3. **Take Action Based on Severity**:

   **If ‚úÖ HEALTHY**:
   - Continue to Step 1 (Update Session History)
   - No action needed

   **If ‚ÑπÔ∏è MONITOR** (breach <14 days):
   - Display warning message
   - Continue to Step 1
   - Consider archiving within next few sessions

   **If ‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING** (‚â•20k tokens OR breach <7 days):
   - **PAUSE session-end workflow**
   - **Present options**:
     ```
     ‚ö†Ô∏è History.md needs archival soon

     Options:
     [1] Archive now (recommended) - will take ~3-5 minutes
     [2] Archive next session - adds "[PLAN] Archive history.md" to TODO
     [3] Continue anyway - I'll handle it manually

     What would you like to do? [1/2/3]
     ```
   - **If [1] selected**:
     * Invoke `/history-management mode=archive`
     * Wait for completion
     * Send notification: `notify-claude "[PLAN] ‚úÖ History archived" --type=progress --priority=low`
     * Resume session-end workflow (continue to Step 1)

   - **If [2] selected**:
     * Add "[PLAN] Archive history.md" to TODO list
     * Send notification: `notify-claude "[PLAN] History archive deferred to next session" --type=task --priority=medium`
     * Resume session-end workflow (continue to Step 1)

   - **If [3] selected**:
     * Log decision
     * Send notification: `notify-claude "[PLAN] ‚ö†Ô∏è Continuing with large history.md (manual handling)" --type=alert --priority=medium`
     * Resume session-end workflow (continue to Step 1)

   **If üö® CRITICAL** (‚â•22k tokens OR breach <3 days):
   - **BLOCK session-end workflow**
   - **Require immediate archival**:
     ```
     üö® CRITICAL: History.md must be archived immediately

     Current: {X} tokens (limit: 25,000)
     Status: Will breach in <3 days at current velocity

     Invoking /history-management mode=archive...
     ```
   - Execute archive workflow automatically
   - Send urgent notification: `notify-claude "[PLAN] üö® Critical: History archived to prevent limit breach" --type=alert --priority=urgent`
   - After completion, resume session-end workflow (continue to Step 1)

**Rationale**: Checking BEFORE adding new content prevents situations where updating history pushes file over 25k limit.

**Notification**: Health check results are automatically sent via notify-claude if severity >= MONITOR.

## 1) Update Session History

**Target**: Record in main `history.md` under current month section

**Requirements**:
- Use date format: `yyyy.mm.dd`
- Sort newest changes at TOP ( reverse chronological )
- Keep track of where we are and write a quick todo list for tomorrow's restart

**For complete history management guidelines**: See planning-is-prompting repo ‚Üí workflow/history-management.md

**Quick Summary**:
- Maintain 30-day window in main file ( ~3k tokens target )
- Archive when approaching 25k token limit
- Current project status summary at top ( 3 lines )
- Session summary with accomplishments

## 2) Update Planning and Tracking Documents

**Target**: Documents in the repo's `src/rnd` directory

**Requirements**:
- Update any relevant planning documents modified during session
- Add links to new research documents in readme file
- All research documents should begin with date format: `yyyy.mm.dd`

## 3) Summarize Uncommitted Changes

**Command**: Use `git status` to track file changes, creations, and deletions

**Output Format**: Comprehensive summary of:
- Modified files
- New files created
- Deleted files
- Staged vs unstaged changes

**Alternative Command**: For tree view of untracked files:
```bash
git ls-files --others --exclude-standard | tree --fromfile -a
```

## 4) Propose Commit Message

**Format**: Use summary + listed items format

**Guidelines**:
- Concise summary line
- Bullet points listing main changes
- Focus on "why" rather than just "what"

## 5) Commit Changes

**Critical Requirements**:
- **MUST ALWAYS stop and wait for user response** for both commits and push confirmations
- DO NOT continue to next steps until user responds
- After approval, commit and offer to push
- Note: Not all repos can be pushed, but always ask

**Git Safety Protocol**:
- NEVER run destructive/irreversible git commands (like push --force, hard reset, etc) unless user explicitly requests
- NEVER skip hooks (--no-verify, --no-gpg-sign, etc) unless user explicitly requests
- NEVER run force push to main/master, warn user if they request it
- Avoid `git commit --amend` unless (1) user explicitly requested amend OR (2) adding edits from pre-commit hook


## Final Verification

At the end of every session when user says goodbye, verify completion of the mandatory end-of-session summarization documentation.

## Project-Specific Context

**Project**: Planning is Prompting
**Prefix**: [PLAN]
**History Location**: `/mnt/DATA01/include/www.deepily.ai/projects/planning-is-prompting/history.md`
**Current Implementation Document**: Referenced at top of history.md

**Key Archived Periods**:
- None yet

**Archive Location**: `history/` directory with monthly organization

## Special Considerations

- When working with multiple repos, always use `[PLAN]` prefix for clarity
- Maintain organization across all steps to demonstrate thoroughness
- Always wait for explicit approval before committing changes
