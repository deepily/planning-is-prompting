# Planning is Prompting - Start Here

**Purpose:** Entry point for the "Planning is Prompting" workflow system - a structured approach to planning and tracking work that creates shared mental models between humans and AI.

**When to use:** Beginning any new work (feature, bug fix, research, architecture) or when you need to organize complex tasks.

**What you'll learn:**
- The "Planning is Prompting" philosophy
- Which workflows to use for your specific work
- How to navigate the two-step process
- Common scenarios and examples

---

## What is "Planning is Prompting"?

**Core Insight**: The structure you create for planning work IS a form of prompting. By organizing work into patterns, phases, and tasks, you create a framework that prompts decision-making, action, and progress.

### How Structure Creates Prompts

When you create a structured plan, it continuously asks questions:
- "What phase am I in?" → Prompts context awareness
- "What's the next task?" → Prompts action
- "What decisions have been made?" → Prompts consistency
- "What's been completed?" → Prompts progress tracking
- "What's the definition of done?" → Prompts completion criteria

### Benefits

1. **Shared Mental Model**: Human and AI align on goals, approach, and progress
2. **Reduced Cognitive Load**: Structure handles "what's next" so you can focus on "how to do it"
3. **Better Decision Making**: Patterns provide decision frameworks
4. **Progress Visibility**: TodoWrite creates real-time progress tracking
5. **Knowledge Capture**: Archival preserves learnings for future reference

## The Two-Step Process

"Planning is Prompting" consists of two core workflows that work together:

```

### Step 1: Planning the Work (Always Required)

**File**: `p-is-p-01-planning-the-work.md`

**What it does**:
- Classifies your work type through discovery questions
- Recommends one of 5 planning patterns
- Breaks down work into manageable tasks
- Creates TodoWrite list for progress tracking

**Patterns**:
1. **Multi-Phase Implementation**: Complex projects with 3+ distinct phases (8+ weeks)
2. **Research & Exploration**: Investigation-focused work with findings/recommendations
3. **Feature Development**: Well-scoped features in existing systems (1-3 weeks)
4. **Problem Investigation**: Systematic debugging with hypothesis testing
5. **Architecture & Design**: System-level design and decision documentation

**Time investment**: 15-30 minutes
**Output**: Clear plan with tasks, pattern selection, TodoWrite list

### Step 2: Documenting the Implementation (Conditional)

**File**: `p-is-p-02-documenting-the-implementation.md`

**When to use**: Only for large/complex work (Pattern 1, 2, or 5 from Step 1)

**What it does**:
- Creates structured documentation (multiple markdown files)
- Manages token budgets to stay under 25k limits
- Establishes archival strategies for completed phases
- Maintains cross-references for navigation

**When to skip**: Small/simple work (Pattern 3 or 4) - use history.md only

**Time investment**: 20-40 minutes (one-time setup)
**Output**: Document structure with index, implementation docs, architecture docs

## Decision Matrix: Which Workflows Do You Need?

This is the **heart** of "Planning is Prompting" - use this matrix to determine your workflow path:

| Work Type | Example | Duration | Pattern (Step 1) | Need Step 2? | Workflow Path |
|-----------|---------|----------|------------------|--------------|---------------|
| **Small feature** | Email notifications | 1-2 weeks | Pattern 3: Feature Dev | ✗ No | → **01** only → history.md |
| **Bug investigation** | WebSocket routing bug | 3-5 days | Pattern 4: Investigation | ✗ No | → **01** only → history.md |
| **Quick research** | Library evaluation | 1 week | Pattern 2: Research (small) | ✗ No | → **01** only → history.md |
| **Medium research** | WebSocket arch evaluation | 2-3 weeks | Pattern 2: Research | ✓ Yes | → **01** → **02** (Pattern C) |
| **Architecture design** | Microservices design | 4-6 weeks | Pattern 5: Architecture | ✓ Yes | → **01** → **02** (Pattern B) |
| **Large implementation** | JWT authentication | 8-12 weeks | Pattern 1: Multi-Phase | ✓ Yes | → **01** → **02** (Pattern A) |
| **Research-driven build** | Agent system (e.g., Google ADK) | 6-10 weeks | Pattern 6: Research-Driven | ✓ Yes | → **Phase 0** → **01** → **02** (B+A) |

### First Decision: Do You Have Existing Research?

**Key question**: Do you have external research materials, documentation, or recommendations to synthesize BEFORE planning implementation?

```
Do you have existing research/docs to process first?
├─ YES → Use Pattern 6 (Research-Driven Implementation)
│         • Start with Phase 0 (Research Synthesis)
│         • Then Phase 1 (Architecture Design using p-is-p-02 Pattern B)
│         • Then Phase 2 (Implementation Planning using p-is-p-02 Pattern A)
│         • Requires Step 2: Yes (both Pattern B + Pattern A)
│
└─ NO → Continue to pattern selection below
        Use decision matrix to select Pattern 1-5
```

**Examples of existing research scenarios**:
- Building with new SDK/framework (Google ADK, LangChain, etc.)
- Have vendor documentation or architectural recommendations
- Implementing from technical specifications or RFCs
- Have use case requirements needing technology mapping

**Not existing research** (use other patterns):
- Doing your own research/exploration → Pattern 2
- Already understand the technology → Pattern 1, 3, 4, or 5

### Quick Decision Rules

**Use Step 1 only** (history.md for tracking) if:
- ✓ Duration < 2 weeks
- ✓ Single phase or linear workflow
- ✓ Documentation will stay < 5,000 tokens
- ✓ Pattern 3 (Feature Dev) or Pattern 4 (Investigation)

**Use Step 1 + Step 2** (dedicated docs) if:
- ✓ Duration 8+ weeks
- ✓ Multiple distinct phases (3+)
- ✓ Documentation will exceed 10,000 tokens
- ✓ Pattern 1 (Multi-Phase), Pattern 2 (Research), or Pattern 5 (Architecture)

**Complete flow**:

```
1. START: p-is-p-01-planning-the-work.md
   - Discovery: Implementation, 8-12 weeks, 8 distinct phases
   - Pattern: Pattern 1 (Multi-Phase Implementation)

2. DECISION MATRIX: Pattern 1 → Use Step 2

3. STEP 2: p-is-p-02-documenting-the-implementation.md
   - Create Pattern A structure:

   - ADK Constraints: Async execution required, context limits, rate limits
   - Recommended Patterns: Agent-Tool-Memory architecture, ReAct prompting strategy
   - Use Case Mapping: Support agent needs NLU + ticketing tools, Analysis agent needs data tools
   - Design Implications: Need extensible plugin system, context windowing, async architecture

WEEK 2-3: Architecture Design (Phase 1)

4. CONTINUE: p-is-p-01 Phase 1 (Discovery) + Phase 2 (Pattern Selection)
   Discovery answers:
   - Work type: Implementation (research-driven)
   - Duration: 6-10 weeks
   - Phases: 6 distinct phases identified
   Pattern selected: Pattern 6 (Research-Driven Implementation)
   Need Step 2: Yes (both Pattern B and Pattern A)

5. STEP 2: p-is-p-02 Pattern B (Architecture & Design)
   Create: src/rnd/adk-agent/ directory structure

   Files created:
   ├── 00-index.md (navigation hub)
   ├── 01-system-context.md (use case requirements)
   ├── 02-architecture-overview.md (Agent-Tool-Memory pattern from ADK)
   ├── 03-component-design.md (Agent Engine, Tool Registry, Context Store)
   ├── 05-integration-patterns.md (tool calling protocol, ReAct prompting)
   └── 07-decision-rationale.md (all decisions trace to research findings)

   TODOWRITE (Phase 1):
   [AGENT] Design system architecture using Agent-Tool-Memory pattern
   [AGENT] Design Agent Engine component (based on ADK framework)
   [AGENT] Design Tool Registry component (based on ADK tool integration)
   [AGENT] Design Context Store component (based on ADK memory + our windowing)
   [AGENT] Document integration patterns (ADK tool protocol + ReAct)
   [AGENT] Document design decisions with research rationale
   [AGENT] Review architecture against both use cases

6. ARCHITECTURE OUTPUT:
   Key components derived from research:
   - Agent Engine: Orchestrates behavior (ADK Agent Framework)
   - Tool Registry: Plugin system (ADK Tool Integration)
   - Context Store: Token-aware memory (ADK Memory + windowing strategy)
   - Support Agent: Customer support specialization (Use Case 1)
   - Analysis Agent: Data analysis specialization (Use Case 2)

   Key decisions traced to research:
   - D001: Context windowing (addresses ADK 100K limit)
   - D002: Request queuing (addresses ADK rate limits)
   - D003: Async architecture (required by ADK)
   - D004: Plugin extensibility (enabled by ADK design)

WEEK 3: Implementation Planning (Phase 2)

7. STEP 2: p-is-p-02 Pattern A (Implementation Tracking)
   Create: src/rnd/adk-agent/01-implementation-current.md

   Derive implementation phases from architecture:
   Phase 1: ADK Integration & Agent Framework Setup
   Phase 2: Tool Registry & Plugin System
   Phase 3: Context/Memory Management with Windowing
   Phase 4: Customer Support Agent Implementation (Use Case 1)
   Phase 5: Data Analysis Agent Implementation (Use Case 2)
   Phase 6: Testing, Validation & Documentation

   TODOWRITE (Phase 2):
   [AGENT] Break down Phase 1 into tasks (ADK SDK setup, base agent class, etc.)
   [AGENT] Break down Phase 2 into tasks (tool interface, registry, plugin loading)
   [AGENT] Break down Phase 3 into tasks (context store, windowing, persistence)
   [AGENT] Break down Phase 4 into tasks (support agent, ticketing tools, NLU)
   [AGENT] Break down Phase 5 into tasks (analysis agent, data tools, viz)
   [AGENT] Break down Phase 6 into tasks (test suites, validation, docs)
   [AGENT] Identify cross-phase dependencies
   [AGENT] Create timeline estimates
   [AGENT] Finalize implementation tracking document

WEEK 4-10: Implementation Execution (Phases 3-N)

8. EXECUTE: Work through implementation phases using Pattern 1 flow

   Phase 1 TodoWrite (example):
   [AGENT] Install Google ADK SDK and dependencies
   [AGENT] Create base agent class implementing ADK interface
   [AGENT] Implement ADK tool integration hooks
   [AGENT] Create agent configuration system
   [AGENT] Write unit tests for base agent
   [AGENT] Archive Phase 1 when complete

   Phase 2 TodoWrite (example):
   [AGENT] Define tool interface following ADK protocol
   [AGENT] Implement tool registry with discovery
   [AGENT] Create plugin loading system
   [AGENT] Add tool validation and error handling
   [AGENT] Write integration tests for tool system
   [AGENT] Archive Phase 2 when complete

   ... (continue through all phases)

9. TRACKING & ARCHIVAL:
   - Active phases in 01-implementation-current.md
   - Completed phases archived to archive/phases-XX-YY-completed.md
   - Architecture and decisions remain in separate files
   - Research synthesis referenced throughout implementation
   - Token budgets maintained via archival strategy

10. INTEGRATION POINTS:
    Throughout implementation:
    - Reference research synthesis for ADK best practices
    - Reference architecture docs for component specs
    - Reference decision docs for design rationale
    - Update implementation docs as phases complete
    - Archive old phases to maintain token budgets
```

**Key Success Factors**:
- **Week 1 synthesis** prevented weeks of rework later
- **Research traceability**: Every design decision traces to research findings
- **Pattern application**: ADK's Agent-Tool-Memory pattern adopted directly
- **Use case alignment**: Both use cases validated against architecture
- **TodoWrite discipline**: One phase in_progress, complete before moving on
- **Document integration**: Research → Architecture → Implementation chain clear

**Dedicated docs required**:
- Research synthesis (Phase 0 output)
- Architecture design (Pattern B docs)
- Implementation tracking (Pattern A docs)
- Total: ~40,000 tokens across multiple files, all under 25K individually

## Integration with Other Workflows

The "Planning is Prompting" core workflows integrate with supporting workflows:

### Session Start
**File**: `session-start.md`
**Integration**: Read history.md to understand previous work, review TodoWrite lists from p-is-p-01

### Session End
**File**: `session-end.md`
**Integration**: Update history.md with completed tasks from TodoWrite, capture decisions and learnings

### History Management
**File**: `history-management.md`
**Integration**: Archive old history.md content when approaching token limits (similar to archival in p-is-p-02)

### Commit Management
**File**: `commit-management.md`
**Integration**: Commit completed phases with descriptive messages based on work from p-is-p-01 and p-is-p-02

### Notification System
**File**: `notification-system.md`
**Integration**: Send notifications at key milestones (phase completion, blocker encountered, approval needed)

## Summary: Your Next Steps

**If you're starting new work**:
1. Open `p-is-p-01-planning-the-work.md`
2. Answer discovery questions
3. Get pattern recommendation
4. Check decision matrix in this document
5. If Pattern 1, 2, or 5 → Also use `p-is-p-02-documenting-the-implementation.md`
6. If Pattern 3 or 4 → Skip to execution, use history.md
7. Create TodoWrite list
8. Begin work

**If you're continuing existing work**:
1. Check history.md for previous session summary
2. Review TodoWrite list from last session
3. Continue where you left off
4. Update implementation docs (if using p-is-p-02)
5. Update history.md at session end

**If you're uncertain which workflow to use**:
1. Start with the decision matrix above
2. Consider work duration, complexity, and phases
3. When in doubt, start with p-is-p-01 and let pattern selection guide you
4. You can always add p-is-p-02 later if work grows larger than expected

---

## Key Principles

1. **Structure IS the prompt**: Your planning framework guides both human and AI thinking
2. **Pattern-driven**: Let work characteristics determine the pattern, not intuition
3. **Adaptive**: Plans can evolve as you learn more about the work
4. **Progressive detail**: Start high-level (p-is-p-01), add detail as needed (p-is-p-02)
5. **Knowledge capture**: Archive learnings for future reference
6. **TodoWrite discipline**: One task in_progress at a time, mark completed immediately
