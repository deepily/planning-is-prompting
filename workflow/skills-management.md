# Skills Management Workflow

**Purpose**: Ongoing Agent Skills lifecycle management - discovery, creation, editing, auditing, and deletion of skills across repositories. Skills live in target repos (`.claude/skills/`), while this workflow provides a reusable pattern for maintaining them.

**When to use**:
- Discovering documentation that should become skills
- Creating new skills from existing documentation
- Updating skills as requirements change
- Auditing skill health against current documentation
- Removing obsolete skills

**Key capabilities**:
- Five operational modes (discover, create, edit, audit, delete)
- Progressive disclosure pattern (metadata → instructions → references)
- Token-aware skill design (<500 lines per SKILL.md)
- Intent-based activation via trigger-rich descriptions
- Integration with Planning-is-Prompting workflows

---

## The Problem with Passive Documentation

### Context Dilution
Large repositories often have extensive documentation with nuances - testing caveats, deployment rules, API conventions. This documentation is:
- Read once at session start
- Forgotten as context fills with task-specific content
- "Rediscovered" after failures ("I forgot Claude doesn't know about the integration test server requirement")

### No Activation Trigger
Saying "run tests" doesn't invoke testing-specific knowledge. The AI needs explicit reminders:
- "Remember, integration tests require the server running"
- "Don't forget to use mocks for external APIs"
- "Check the flaky tests list first"

### Documentation Drift
Documentation evolves with the codebase, but passive docs don't adapt:
- New testing patterns added, but old patterns still documented
- Deprecated approaches remain in CLAUDE.md
- No mechanism to detect stale documentation

---

## Agent Skills Architecture

### Overview

Agent Skills (per agentskills.io specification) provide **intent-based activation**:
- ~100 tokens loaded at startup (name + description only)
- Full instructions (<5000 tokens) loaded **when skill activates**
- Progressive disclosure: SKILL.md → references/ → scripts/ → assets/

### Required Frontmatter

```yaml
---
name: skill-name           # 1-64 chars, lowercase, hyphens only
description: What it does and WHEN to use it  # 1-1024 chars, trigger-rich
---
```

### Optional Frontmatter

```yaml
---
name: testing-patterns
description: Testing patterns for this project. Use when writing tests, running pytest, debugging failures, or choosing smoke/unit/integration tests.
license: MIT
compatibility: Python 3.9+, pytest 7.0+
metadata:
  author: team-name
  version: "1.0"
  last-updated: "2026-01-28"
allowed-tools:
  - Bash
  - Read
---
```

### Directory Structure

```
.claude/skills/
└── skill-name/
    ├── SKILL.md              # Required (<500 lines recommended)
    ├── scripts/              # Executable code (optional)
    ├── references/           # Detailed docs (loaded on demand)
    └── assets/               # Templates, images, data files
```

### Token Budget (Progressive Disclosure)

| Layer | Content | Budget | When Loaded |
|-------|---------|--------|-------------|
| Metadata | name + description | ~100 tokens | Startup (ALL skills) |
| Instructions | SKILL.md body | <5000 tokens | Skill activation |
| Resources | references/, scripts/ | As needed | Explicit reference |

**Key Insight**: Write trigger-rich descriptions that include both WHAT the skill does AND WHEN to use it.

### Trigger-Rich Description Examples

**Good** (trigger-rich):
```yaml
description: Testing patterns and caveats for this project. Use when writing tests, running pytest, debugging test failures, choosing between smoke/unit/integration tests, or fixing flaky tests.
```

**Bad** (vague):
```yaml
description: Helps with testing.
```

## Workflow Modes

### Mode: discover

**Purpose**: Find documentation candidates for skill conversion

**When to use**:
- Starting skills adoption in a repository
- Periodic review for new skill opportunities
- After major documentation updates

**Process**:

1. **Scan Configuration Files for Conditional Knowledge**

   **Scan Order** (processes in this sequence):
   1. Global `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` (user-level defaults)
   2. Project `CLAUDE.md` at repository root (project-specific overrides)
   3. `README.md` at repository root (project overview, often links to detailed docs)
   4. Documentation linked from README (follow links to other .md files)
   5. `docs/`, `workflow/`, `src/rnd/` directories
   6. `history.md` for rediscovery patterns

   **What to look for**:
   - "if X then Y" patterns (conditional knowledge)
   - Sections with caveats, exceptions, or context-dependent rules
   - Knowledge that requires remembering across tasks
   - README sections describing project capabilities (prime skill candidates)

2. **Scan Documentation Directories**
   - Check `docs/`, `workflow/`, `src/rnd/` for domain-specific docs
   - Identify documents >200 lines (candidates for extraction)
   - Flag documents frequently referenced in CLAUDE.md or README
   - **Follow links**: If README links to `docs/architecture.md`, scan that too

3. **Identify Rediscovery Patterns**
   - Review history.md for repeated mistakes or reminders
   - Check for patterns like "Remember to...", "Don't forget..."
   - Identify knowledge that's frequently "relearned"

4. **Generate Candidate Report**

**Output Format**:
```
📋 Skill Candidates Report
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Source: Global CLAUDE.md (~/.claude/CLAUDE.md)
1. notification-patterns
   - Section: "CLAUDE CODE NOTIFICATION SYSTEM"
   - Conditional knowledge: when to use notify vs ask_yes_no vs converse
   - Size: ~400 lines → needs split (SKILL.md + references/)
   - Trigger keywords: notify, notification, cosa-voice, alert

Source: Project CLAUDE.md
2. testing-patterns
   - Section: "Testing & Incremental Development"
   - Conditional knowledge: smoke vs unit vs integration
   - Size: ~800 lines → needs split (SKILL.md + references/)
   - Trigger keywords: pytest, test, smoke, unit, integration

3. path-management
   - Section: "PATH MANAGEMENT"
   - Conditional knowledge: bootstrap files vs regular code
   - Size: ~200 lines → fits in single SKILL.md
   - Trigger keywords: path, import, sys.path, LUPIN_ROOT

Source: README.md (linked docs)
4. api-endpoints
   - Linked from: README.md → docs/api-reference.md
   - Explicit API documentation with conventions
   - Size: ~350 lines → SKILL.md + references/
   - Trigger keywords: endpoint, REST, API, route

Source: workflow/
5. session-workflows
   - File: session-end.md
   - Explicit workflow with multiple steps
   - Size: ~300 lines → SKILL.md + references/
   - Trigger keywords: session end, wrap up, commit

Recommendations:
- Priority 1: testing-patterns (high rediscovery frequency)
- Priority 2: path-management (common errors)
- Priority 3: notification-patterns (conditional usage rules)
- Priority 4: session-workflows (explicit workflow)

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Scanned: 6 sources | Candidates found: 5

To create a skill: /plan-skills-management create <skill-name>
Or suggest a topic: Type a topic name to analyze for skill potential
```

5. **User-Suggested Topics** (Interactive)

   After presenting the candidate report, ask the user:
   ```
   Would you like to suggest a topic not found in the scan?

   You can propose any topic you think should become a skill.
   I'll search the codebase and documentation to see if there's
   enough substance for a skill.

   Enter topic name (or press Enter to skip): _
   ```

   **If user suggests a topic**:
   - Search CLAUDE.md, README.md, and docs/ for related content
   - Look for the topic name, synonyms, and related keywords
   - Analyze whether there's enough conditional knowledge (>50 lines)
   - Report findings:

   ```
   📋 Topic Analysis: <suggested-topic>
   ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

   Search Results:
   ✅ Found in CLAUDE.md (lines 245-320): "Error Handling" section
   ✅ Found in docs/error-codes.md: Error code reference
   ⚠️  Not found in README.md

   Content Analysis:
   - Total relevant content: ~180 lines
   - Conditional knowledge: Yes (error types, handling strategies)
   - Trigger keywords: error, exception, catch, handle, throw

   Recommendation: ✅ VIABLE - Sufficient content for skill

   To create: /plan-skills-management create error-handling
   ```

   **If topic not viable**:
   ```
   📋 Topic Analysis: <suggested-topic>
   ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

   Search Results:
   ⚠️  Minimal references found (12 lines total)
   ⚠️  No conditional knowledge detected
   ⚠️  Content too brief for meaningful skill

   Recommendation: ❌ NOT VIABLE - Insufficient content

   Options:
   [1] Add documentation first, then create skill
   [2] Combine with related topic (suggest alternatives)
   [3] Create minimal skill anyway (not recommended)
   ```

---

### Mode: create

**Purpose**: Build a new skill from documentation

**When to use**:
- After `discover` identifies a candidate
- When creating a skill from scratch
- When extracting knowledge from CLAUDE.md
- When creating from a user-suggested topic (even if not in discover list)

**Process**:

**Step 0: Topic Resolution** (if skill name not from discover list)

If the skill name wasn't in the discover candidate list:
```
Topic not found in discover candidates.

Searching for "<skill-name>" across documentation...

Search Results:
[List of files/sections where topic was found]

Would you like to proceed with skill creation? [y/n]
```

If no content found:
```
No documentation found for "<skill-name>".

Options:
[1] Create skill from scratch (you'll provide the content)
[2] Search with different keywords
[3] Cancel and run /plan-skills-management discover first

Select option: _
```

**Step 1: Identify Source Documentation**
```
Creating skill: <skill-name>

Source options:
[1] CLAUDE.md section: "<section-name>"
[2] Project CLAUDE.md section: "<section-name>"
[3] README.md section or linked doc
[4] File: <path/to/file.md>
[5] Multiple sources (will merge)
[6] From template
[7] From scratch (no existing docs)

Select source: _
```

**Step 2: Design Skill Granularity**
```
Skill Granularity Analysis
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Source content: ~800 lines

Options:
[1] Single skill (testing-patterns)
    - SKILL.md: ~180 lines (quick reference + key rules)
    - references/: 4 files (detailed patterns)

[2] Multiple skills (testing-smoke, testing-unit, testing-integration)
    - 3 separate skills
    - Each ~150 lines
    - More specific triggers

Recommendation: [1] Single skill with references/
Rationale: Related knowledge, shared context, natural grouping

Select approach: _
```

**Step 3: Write SKILL.md**

Generate skill with:
- YAML frontmatter (name, trigger-rich description)
- Quick reference table
- Core rules and patterns
- Anti-patterns section
- References to detailed docs

**Step 4: Extract Detailed Content to references/**

If source >500 lines:
- Create `references/` directory
- Extract detailed patterns to separate files
- Keep SKILL.md as quick reference with links

**Step 5: Validate Format**
```
Skill Validation
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

✅ Frontmatter valid (name, description present)
✅ Name format correct (lowercase, hyphens)
✅ Description length OK (245 chars < 1024 max)
✅ SKILL.md under 500 lines (178 lines)
✅ References accessible
⚠️ Suggestion: Add more trigger keywords to description

Current triggers: "testing", "pytest", "test"
Suggested additions: "debug", "failure", "flaky", "mock"
```

**Step 6: Test Intent Detection**
```
Intent Detection Test
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Test phrases:
✅ "run the tests" → skill activated
✅ "I need to write unit tests" → skill activated
✅ "pytest is failing" → skill activated
✅ "debug test failure" → skill activated
⚠️ "check the code" → NOT activated (expected)

Skill should activate for testing-related intents.
Test passed.
```

**Output**:
```
✅ Skill Created Successfully

## Skill Templates

Templates are available in `planning-is-prompting → workflow/skill-templates/`:

| Template | Use Case |
|----------|----------|
| `testing-skill-template.md` | Testing patterns, pytest, smoke/unit/integration |
| `api-skill-template.md` | API conventions, endpoints, authentication |
| `generic-skill-template.md` | Minimal starting template for any domain |

To use a template:
```
/plan-skills-management create <skill-name>

Select source:
[4] From template

Available templates:
[1] testing-skill-template
[2] api-skill-template
[3] generic-skill-template
```

---

## Anti-Patterns

### Skills Too Long
**Problem**: SKILL.md >500 lines defeats progressive disclosure
**Solution**: Extract detailed content to `references/` directory

### Vague Descriptions
**Problem**: "Helps with testing" won't trigger on specific intents
**Solution**: Include explicit trigger keywords: "Use when writing tests, running pytest, debugging failures"

### Missing Trigger Keywords
**Problem**: User says "run integration tests" but skill doesn't activate
**Solution**: Include domain-specific terms in description: pytest, mock, fixture, flaky, etc.

### Duplicating CLAUDE.md
**Problem**: Skill copies content verbatim from CLAUDE.md
**Solution**: Extract and refine; CLAUDE.md should reference skill, not duplicate

### No References Directory
**Problem**: Large skill crammed into single SKILL.md
**Solution**: Split into SKILL.md (quick reference) + references/ (details)

### Stale Skills
**Problem**: Documentation evolved but skill didn't
**Solution**: Regular audits with `/plan-skills-management audit`

---

## Integration with Planning-is-Prompting Workflows

### Skills vs. Slash Commands

| Aspect | Skills | Slash Commands |
|--------|--------|----------------|
| Activation | Automatic (intent-based) | Explicit (`/command`) |
| Token Loading | On-demand | Full prompt at invocation |
| Use Case | Domain knowledge | Explicit workflows |
| Example | Testing patterns | `/plan-session-end` |

### Complementary Usage

Skills and slash commands work together:
- **Skill**: Provides domain knowledge (testing patterns, API conventions)
- **Slash Command**: Executes explicit workflow (session-end, commit, planning)

### Session-End Integration

Consider adding skill audit reminder to session-end workflow:
```
Session-End Step X: Skills Audit (Optional)
If skills exist in repo and last audit >7 days ago:
  Suggest: /plan-skills-management audit
```

### Skills Can Reference Workflows

Skills can link to workflow documents:
```markdown
## Session Workflows

For session management, see:
- [Session Start](../../workflow/session-start.md)
- [Session End](../../workflow/session-end.md)

Or invoke: `/plan-session-start`, `/plan-session-end`
```

---

## Usage Examples

### Initial Adoption (New Repository)

```bash
# 1. Discover candidates
/plan-skills-management discover

# 2. Review candidates, prioritize
# Output shows: testing-patterns (high), path-management (medium)

# 3. Create highest priority skill
/plan-skills-management create testing-patterns

# 4. Create next priority
/plan-skills-management create path-management

# 5. Verify skills work
# In new session, say "I need to write tests"
# → testing-patterns skill should activate
```

### Ongoing Maintenance

```bash
# Weekly audit
/plan-skills-management audit

# Output shows path-management needs update
/plan-skills-management edit path-management

# Output shows new candidate discovered
/plan-skills-management create error-handling
```

### After Major Documentation Update

```bash
# After updating CLAUDE.md significantly
/plan-skills-management audit

# Multiple skills may need updates
# Work through each:
/plan-skills-management edit skill-1
/plan-skills-management edit skill-2
```

### Removing Obsolete Skill

```bash
# Old authentication method deprecated
/plan-skills-management delete

# Select: deprecated-auth
# Confirm deletion
# Clean up references
```

---

## Project-Specific Customization

When using this workflow in a specific project:

1. **Project Prefix**: Use project's `[SHORT_PROJECT_PREFIX]` in notifications
2. **Skills Location**: Always `.claude/skills/` (standard location)
3. **Documentation Sources**: Identify project's doc locations (CLAUDE.md, docs/, workflow/)
4. **Notification Integration**: Use cosa-voice MCP for progress updates

---

## Notifications

This workflow uses cosa-voice MCP for notifications:

```python
# Discovery complete
notify( "Skills discovery found 3 candidates", notification_type="task", priority="low" )

# Skill created
notify( "Created testing-patterns skill", notification_type="task", priority="medium" )

# Audit warning
notify( "Skills audit: 2 skills need updates", notification_type="alert", priority="high" )

# User decision needed
ask_multiple_choice( questions=[{
    "question": "Which skills should be updated?",
    "header": "Skills Update",
    "multiSelect": True,
    "options": [
        { "label": "testing-patterns", "description": "Source modified 2026-01-25" },
        { "label": "path-management", "description": "Source modified 2026-01-22" }
    ]
}] )
```
