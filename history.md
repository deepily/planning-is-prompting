# Planning is Prompting - Session History

**Current Status**: CLAUDE.md created, INSTALLATION-GUIDE.md completed with reference wrapper pattern, slash commands implemented for self-management.
**Next Steps**: Test slash commands in practice, populate remaining workflow content templates, demonstrate workflows in other repos.

### 2025.10.01 - Session 2: CLAUDE.md, Installation Guide & Self-Management

**Accomplishments**:
- Created `CLAUDE.md` for this repository with portable path references
- Updated `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` to use portable format (planning-is-prompting → workflow/...)
- Replaced hardcoded `[PLAN]` with `[SHORT_PROJECT_PREFIX]` in workflow/session-end.md (13 occurrences)
- Created comprehensive `workflow/INSTALLATION-GUIDE.md` (436 lines) with:
  - Slash command naming convention (`/<lowercase-prefix>-<workflow-name>`)
  - Installation prompts for all workflows
  - Session-End, History Management, Session-Start, Work Planning, Notifications, Commit Management sections
- Simplified History Management section using reference wrapper pattern (reduced ~90 lines)
- Created `.claude/commands/` directory with three slash commands:
  - `plan-history-management.md` - 4 modes (check/archive/analyze/dry-run)
  - `plan-session-end.md` - Complete session-end ritual
  - `plan-session-start.md` - Session initialization
- All slash commands follow reference wrapper pattern (read canonical doc on every invocation)

**Key Design Decisions**:
- Use `[SHORT_PROJECT_PREFIX]` placeholder for reusability across projects
- Slash command naming: `/<lowercase-prefix>-<workflow-name>` prevents multi-repo conflicts
- **Reference wrapper pattern**: Slash commands read canonical docs on each invocation (true reuse, not duplication)
- Self-management: This repo uses its own workflows (dogfooding)
- Installation guide eliminates duplication - all implementation details stay in canonical docs

**TODO for Next Session**:
- [ ] Test `/plan-session-end`, `/plan-history-management`, `/plan-session-start` slash commands
- [ ] Populate content in remaining workflow stub files (work-planning.md, commit-management.md, notification-system.md, session-start.md)
- [ ] Add example inputs/outputs to README.md
- [ ] Demonstrate workflow installation in another repo

### 2025.09.30 - Session 1: Initial Repository Setup & Workflow Structure

**Accomplishments**:
- Fixed typo in README.md ( "Kodex" → "Codex" )
- Created `.gitignore` file for Python project ( .venv/, .claude/, .idea/, Python cache )
- Renamed `rnd/` directory to `workflow/` for better clarity
- Created workflow skeleton files:
  - `claude-config-global.md` - Global configuration template
  - `claude-config-local.md` - Project-specific configuration template
  - `session-start.md` - Session initialization prompts
  - `session-end.md` - Session wrap-up workflow
  - `history-management.md` - History management workflow
  - `work-planning.md` - Task planning prompts
  - `commit-management.md` - Git workflow prompts
  - `notification-system.md` - Notification usage prompts
- Updated root `README.md` with comprehensive workflow structure and links
- Populated `claude-config-global.md` with complete contents from `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`
- Condensed history management section in global config to reference canonical workflow
- Fixed path reference to use portable format: "See planning-is-prompting repo → workflow/history-management.md"
- Streamlined session-end.md by removing redundant history management details and referencing canonical document
- **Tested session-end workflow** by reading and executing the document

**Key Design Decisions**:
- Organize by workflow phase ( session-start, planning, history, session-end ) not by tool
- Use separate files for each workflow modality
- Keep concise quick-reference in global config, detailed canonical versions in workflow files
- Single README.md in root ( no separate workflow README )
- Reference canonical workflows using portable "See repo → path" format

**TODO for Next Session**:
- [ ] Populate remaining workflow files from existing repos
- [ ] Create local CLAUDE.md template with [SHORT_PROJECT_PREFIX] example
- [ ] Add example inputs/outputs to README.md
- [ ] Test workflow integration across multiple sessions
