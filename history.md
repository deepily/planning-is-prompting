# Planning is Prompting - Session History

**RESUME HERE**: **Session 94 second bundle LANDED — Step 6 reliability fix + Recommendation Mandate codification** (María `d66169f2`, 2026-05-21 afternoon, post-lunch continuation). Two complementary tracks committed together. **Track 1 (Step 6 reliability)**: §6 renamed "Day's Work Summary" → "LoC Delta Summary (Day's Work)" matching Rick's verbal vocabulary; soft-skip language promoted to MANDATE with three obligations (MUST fire / MUST surface table in abstract / MUST speak one-line LoC verdict in spoken message); Final Verification section expanded with a 5-checkbox Step-6 Accountability Checklist; `/plan-session-end` slash wrapper got stiffened invocation language naming all three obligations; `~/.claude/skills/codebase-analysis/SKILL.md` trigger phrases extended with session-end vocabulary (`session end`, `LoC delta closer`, `Step 6`, `daily LoC summarizer`). Bonus fix: §6.4 CSV doc-link URL form upgraded from legacy two-param (`&scope=`) to canonical path-only — bringing this section into compliance with the morning's doc-link doctrine reconciliation. **Track 2 (Recommendation Mandate)**: new `### Recommendation Mandate for Blocking-Tool Asks` sub-section in `workflow/cosa-voice-integration.md § Blocking Decisions` — mandates pros AND cons per option + explicit recommendation with rationale in every `ask_multiple_choice` / `ask_yes_no` / `converse` abstract; includes per-tool shape table, worked anti-pattern vs canonical example, prohibited-anti-pattern catalog, and explicit "when the mandate doesn't apply" carve-outs (pure information-gathering, pure confirmation, repeated identical asks). Short headline callout added to `workflow/claude-config-global.md` pointing at canonical hub. Notification Accountability Checkpoint extended with a sixth checkbox tying the mandate to the self-audit gate. **Failure-mode addressed**: prior soft-language allowed agents to interpret Step 6 as optional under wrap-up pressure (the "never fired" head) AND to deliver the table to terminal-only without abstract/spoken-verdict surfacing (the "fired invisibly" head). MANDATE addresses both heads jointly. **Live empirical anchor**: this very session demonstrated the Recommendation Mandate in action — pre-lunch sequencing question shipped with full pros/cons + recommendation, Rick selected "Bundle both" per the recommended option.

**Previously**: **Session 94 doc-link doctrine reconciliation LANDED** (María `d66169f2`, 2026-05-21 morning). Audit triggered by Rick's report of recurring malformed doc-links across repos. Two-DM peer-confirmation round-trip with Tiberius (Lupin session) ratified four corrections beyond the original audit framing: (1) `?scope=` query param is SILENTLY IGNORED by the server (not 400'd), making the purge urgent rather than cosmetic because consumers emit dead syntax without learning; (2) audit missed `retail-ai-location-strategy` in registered-scope enumeration (8 scopes total, not 7); (3) `docs` and `io` shorthand scopes for Lupin files are RETIRED per Phase 4a (any `path=docs/...` returns HTTP 400 "Unknown project"); (4) `get_session_info()` now returns a single string `project` field, not the old 4-field `doc_scope` dict envelope still taught in older material. **Shipped**: NEW canonical hub at `workflow/doc-viewer-links.md` (agent-facing discipline — when/where/how to emit, abstract-only-never-message rule, purge inventory, hub-spoke defers URL grammar + repo registry to Lupin CLAUDE.md). Bounce edits to `workflow/claude-config-global.md` § Persona-First & Doc-Link Literacy (Phase A hooks 4+5 updated to single-string `project`, dead syntax flagged), `workflow/INSTALLATION-GUIDE.md` § Doc Viewer Readiness (URL-form duplication trimmed, hub callout added), `workflow/cosa-voice-integration.md` (stale "not yet surfaced in `get_session_info()`" persona note fixed; anchor-example URL converted to path-only canonical). TODO.md: filed Lupin-context follow-up to update Rick's `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` § DOCUMENT VIEWER LINKS + secondary follow-up to backfill CLAUDE.md into 6 scope-registered repos that lack one. **Process notes**: cross-session DM-as-design-doc pattern again proved high-leverage — Tiberius's authoritative reply structurally sharpened the audit beyond what unilateral inspection would have produced. Ping-discipline feedback saved as memory after Rick flagged ping-without-progress mid-session (recorded as `feedback_ping_discipline_cross_session.md`). Top-3 TODO summary deferred to post-commit per Rick's session-sequencing directive.

**Previously**: **Session 93 v1.1 cascade-doctrine codification pass LANDED** (María `ac2d05c0`, 2026-05-20 morning continuation). After the overnight Run 4 cascade-close, a 2-round María ↔ Tiberius post-cascade retrospective DM thread surfaced **7 v1.1 doctrine candidates + 4 pre-committed re-evaluation gates** (bilateral ratification 2026-05-20). Codification pass executed solo per hub-spoke pattern: María drafts; Tiberius reviews per-artifact (DM `830f4833` carries the pointer-set). Files touched: `workflow/plan-review-cascaded-common.md` (7 distinct edits — NEW §Clarification Tier Vocabulary, §Author-side Discipline Grep-sweep Checklist, §Observer-mode Probe Protocol, §Multi-surface Footer-ratification Close Protocol + 3 extensions to existing sections), `workflow/plan-review-cascaded-personas.md` (NEW Persona 6 Doctrine Observer + 2 extensions), `workflow/plan-review-cascaded-defaults.md` (NEW §Cascade-execution observability config section with 4 new INI keys + 3 new kind enum values; config keys 28 → 32), `workflow/plan-authoring-cascaded.md` + `workflow/plan-review-cascaded.md` (version-history-only entries), `src/rnd/2026.05.17-cascaded-plan-review-pipeline.md` (NEW §10.18.12 Pre-committed re-evaluation gates). Also: ✅ Executive briefing drafted for Rick's external manager at `src/rnd/executive-briefings/2026.05.20-cascaded-review-pipeline-executive-summary.md` (jargon-free, ~7-min read; covers 4-run arc + 2 mermaid architecture diagrams + dedicated Doctrine Observer section); README.md updated with link. Cumulative anchors for AC-table-sweep doctrine now 5 instances across Runs 3+4. Pending: Tiberius review-OK on the codification pass before commit; Rick redline-OK on the exec briefing before he forwards to his manager. Run 4 Step 0 + Step 9 doctrine first-application validated STRONG (overnight cascade close in 1h 30 min wall-clock; first cascade-run with zero user touches per Rick's pre-cascade AFK directive).

**Previously**: **Session 93 Run 4 cascade-CLOSED — Step 0 + Step 9 doctrine first-application validated STRONG** (María `ac2d05c0`, 2026-05-20T03:30:47 UTC). Phase 7a cascade closed in 1h 30 min wall-clock (01:55:34 → 03:30:47 UTC). **First cascade-run with zero user touches** — Rick AFK + asleep for the entire duration, by his explicit pre-cascade directive. T1/T2 silent execution = 100%, zero T3 escalations, zero T4 wake-ups — Tier discipline doctrine validated under explicit unavailable-user constraint. **Step 0 doctrine validated STRONG**: pre-cascade Recon eliminated 6 browser-API archaeology items upstream; 3 reviewers (Rachel/Krishna/Rio) each independently surfaced Recon-Item-N quotes in their stage outputs. **Step 9 doctrine validated STRONG with empirical bonus**: dual-administer cold-context test is ADDITIVE not redundant — Krishna's 7-min light-review caught 2 additional friction points beyond Tiberius's self-administered 3. Net: 5 cold-context observations from 2 independent administrations. **§10.18 retrofit row composed** in `src/rnd/2026.05.17-cascaded-plan-review-pipeline.md` (four-row comparison table extension + Step 0/9 validation evidence + monotonically-decreasing-stage-wall-clock pattern 38→33→21 min as first cascade-learning-loop forward-asymmetry empirical anchor + cap utilization 57% with 50%+ headroom + failure mode #6 `signal-density-obscures-needle` catalog + 5 v1.1 doctrine candidates promoted + 1 placeholder). v1.1 codification coordination with Tiberius scheduled per his availability. Six PIP commits earlier this day + 1 Lupin commit; Run 4 close adds the fourth-run empirical anchor that strengthens the §10.11 verdict. Observer daemon stood down. Push held per Rick's "end of day" directive; commits-only.

**Current Status**: v0.1.2 released, on wip-v0.1.3 branch. Continued development.
**Last Session**: Session 94 (María, `d66169f2`) — **Two bundles landed**: (1) **morning** — doc-link doctrine reconciled across PIP corpus (new canonical hub at `workflow/doc-viewer-links.md`; 3 side-mention files bounced; 2 Lupin-context follow-ups filed; Tiberius peer-confirmation ratified 4 sharpening corrections); (2) **afternoon** — Step 6 LoC Delta Summary reliability fix (rename, MANDATE with 3 obligations, accountability checklist, slash-wrapper stiffening, skill triggers extended, CSV doc-link URL form upgraded to canonical) + Recommendation Mandate codification for blocking-tool asks (new sub-section in `workflow/cosa-voice-integration.md § Blocking Decisions` mandating pros/cons + recommendation in every blocking-tool abstract; headline callout in `workflow/claude-config-global.md`; sixth checkbox added to Notification Accountability Checkpoint).
**Previous Session**: Session 93 (María, `ac2d05c0`) — **Per-Repo Preferred-Persona Env Var feature shipped**. Cross-repo cosa-voice MCP feature making each project's canonical persona declarative via `COSA_VOICE_PREFERRED_PERSONA__<PROJECT>` exports in shell rc; eliminates per-session `/plan-session-start <name>` arg-typing for routine narrative continuity. PIP-side: ~370-line plan doc, ~220 lines of workflow integration across two new Preliminaries, slash-command shim v1.0 → 1.1 with `$ARGS` handling, installation-guide subsection. Lupin-side (Tiberius commit `3bc7b9e`): allocator helper `pick_preferred_persona_from_env(project)`, new `preferred_persona_name` query param on `/allocate` router endpoint with graceful-fallback + `voice_persona_conflict` notify on miss, hook integration in `register_session.py`, 7 new unit tests (42 → 49 green). Rick exported `__PLAN=María` + `__LUPIN=Tiberius` in shell rc + restarted PIP session pre-commit; María session `ac2d05c0` is the integration proof point (`voice_persona.name = "maria"` deterministically on Phase A startup, not randomly).
**Previous Session**: Session 92 (María, `4ee3e0c1`) — Phase D cascaded plan-review prototype: **Run 1 partial + Run 2 complete end-to-end + v2 polish bundle shipped + cascade-as-author doctrine extension shipped + Run 3 Phase 6C authoring-cascade COMPLETE (108 min wall-clock; 43 findings; 91% verbatim-accept; 1 user-escalation; 1 reviewer reassignment due to rate-limit; 4 sections fully closed)**. §10.14 errata queue grew to 9 items for Tiberius's post-Run-3 manager-seat redline. Phase 6C implementation plan ready for Mr. Rick's tomorrow pickup.

## May 2026

### 2026.05.21 - Session 94 (afternoon continuation) — Step 6 Reliability Fix + Recommendation Mandate Codification (María)

**Persona**: María 🌸 (PIP session `d66169f2`; chorus mode; post-lunch continuation of the morning's doc-link doctrine reconciliation session).

**Session purpose** (Rick's post-lunch ask): make the cosa-side LoC delta summarizer fire dependably as the last step of every session-end ritual. He uses the per-day table + per-branch CSV continually for progress tracking; current state is inconsistent firing + invisible surfacing when it does fire. Pivoted into a second concurrent ask: every blocking-tool question Claude Code asks the user should ship with pros/cons + recommendation as standard practice — codify this as a doctrine across the PIP repo.

**Diagnosis** (think-out-loud with Rick, three hypotheses):

1. **Soft-conditional language permits silent skip**. §6 used "Skip condition" phrasing, not MANDATE. The Notification Accountability Checkpoint asked generic questions but did NOT specifically ask "did Step 6 fire? did the table land in abstract?" An agent under wrap-up pressure reads soft-skip as license to omit.
2. **Vocabulary mismatch**. Section was titled "Day's Work Summary" in the workflow doc; Rick verbally calls it the "LoC delta summarizer". Agent skimming the workflow looking for "the thing Rick mentioned" doesn't find it under his vocabulary.
3. **Surfacing is invisible at-a-distance**. Even when §6 fires, the table may only land in terminal text or a partial `notify()` payload. Spoken closing turn doesn't include a LoC verdict; abstract may not always carry the table; CSV doc-link may be malformed.

Recommended bundle (both A + B from the menu, accepted) addresses all three heads jointly.

**Accomplishments (Track 1 — Step 6 reliability)**:

1. **Section rename** `### 6) Day's Work Summary` → `### 6) LoC Delta Summary (Day's Work)` — matches Rick's verbal vocabulary while preserving historical name as parenthetical backward-compat anchor. Cascading renames in §6.1 skip-line messages and §6.4 terminal-output banner.

2. **MANDATE promotion** with three explicit obligations: (a) **MUST fire** — soft-skip is a violation, only valid skips are explicit `--no-summary` or §6.1 preflight failure; (b) **MUST surface the table** in closing `notify()` abstract — terminal-only delivery is invisible delivery for at-a-distance users; (c) **MUST speak a one-line LoC verdict** (≈8-15 words) in spoken `message` REPLACING the generic "session ended" sign-off — provides aural signal that §6 fired without violating TTS Brevity Mandate.

3. **CSV doc-link URL form upgrade** (§6.4) — old: `[Open: …](/app/docs?path=io/…&scope={project-scope})` resolving from `doc_scope` envelope; new: `[Open: …](/app/docs?path={project}/io/…)` path-only canonical form from `get_session_info().project` single string. This bonus fix brings §6.4 into compliance with the morning's doc-link doctrine reconciliation (`workflow/doc-viewer-links.md`).

4. **Final Verification expanded** from a thin one-liner to a substantive 5-checkbox Step-6 Accountability Checklist: did §6 fire? did table land in abstract? did spoken message carry LoC verdict? does CSV doc-link use canonical URL form? if blocking-tool ask was made, does it conform to the Recommendation Mandate?

5. **Slash wrapper stiffening** (`.claude/commands/plan-session-end.md`) — Instruction-to-Claude block expanded with explicit naming of the three Step-6 obligations + new §5 invoking the Accountability Checklist as mandatory clearance gate before declaring session-end complete.

6. **Codebase-analysis skill triggers extended** (`~/.claude/skills/codebase-analysis/SKILL.md`) — added session-end vocabulary to trigger phrases (`session end`, `LoC delta closer`, `Step 6`, `daily LoC summarizer`, etc.) + new activation note stating the skill MUST load when session-end triggers fire. Lives outside PIP repo (user-scope dotfile in `~/.claude/skills/`) so committed only to local disk, not to PIP git.

**Accomplishments (Track 2 — Recommendation Mandate codification)**:

7. **New canonical sub-section** `### Recommendation Mandate for Blocking-Tool Asks (2026-05-21)` in `workflow/cosa-voice-integration.md § Blocking Decisions` (~100 lines) — mandates pros AND cons per option + explicit recommendation with rationale in every `ask_multiple_choice` / `ask_yes_no` / `converse` abstract. Includes: per-tool shape table mapping tool to required abstract structure; worked anti-pattern vs canonical example demonstrating the shape; prohibited-anti-pattern catalog (6 rows: listing options without trade-offs, listing trade-offs without recommendation, recommendation without rationale, "every option is good" recommendation-laundering, pros/cons in spoken message, "skip the mandate for trivial asks"); explicit "when the mandate doesn't apply" carve-outs (pure information-gathering converse, pure confirmation yes/no, repeated identical asks within session).

8. **Headline callout** in `workflow/claude-config-global.md` § CLAUDE CODE NOTIFICATION SYSTEM — short summary + pointer to canonical hub. Keeps global config terse per the hub-spoke discipline.

9. **Notification Accountability Checkpoint extension** in `workflow/cosa-voice-integration.md` — sixth checkbox added: "If I made a blocking-tool ask, does the abstract carry pros/cons + recommendation per the Recommendation Mandate above?" Failure-action updated to include re-issuing blocking-tool asks with missing decision-support added.

**Live empirical anchor** for the Recommendation Mandate: this very session demonstrated it in action. Pre-lunch sequencing question (`ask_multiple_choice` with 3 options for how to land the two bundles) shipped with full pros/cons + recommendation per option + explicit "why I recommend A over B or C" rationale; Rick selected "Bundle both (Recommended)" — matching the recommendation. The mandate IS the pattern we just shipped, applied to its own shipping decision.

**Files Changed**:

| File | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `workflow/session-end.md` | modified | § 6 rename + MANDATE with 3 obligations + URL form upgrade + Final Verification expanded with 5-checkbox accountability checklist |
| `.claude/commands/plan-session-end.md` | modified | Instruction-to-Claude block expanded: three obligations named explicitly; new §5 invokes accountability checklist as mandatory clearance gate |
| `workflow/cosa-voice-integration.md` | modified | NEW § Recommendation Mandate for Blocking-Tool Asks (~100 lines); Notification Accountability Checkpoint extended with 6th checkbox |
| `workflow/claude-config-global.md` | modified | NEW § Recommendation Mandate headline callout under CLAUDE CODE NOTIFICATION SYSTEM, pointing at canonical hub |
| `history.md` | modified | RESUME HERE update + this entry |
| `~/.claude/skills/codebase-analysis/SKILL.md` | modified (out-of-repo) | Trigger phrases extended with session-end vocabulary; activation note added. Lives in user-scope `~/.claude/skills/`, no PIP commit. |

**Doctrine highlight**: the Recommendation Mandate is a sister doctrine to the existing "abstract carries the inventory" rule from the TTS Brevity Mandate. The brevity mandate said *data* belongs in `abstract` not spoken `message`; the Recommendation Mandate extends this to *decision-support* (pros/cons + recommendation). Same channel-asymmetry rationale (voice = verdict; abstract = full record), applied to blocking-tool framing instead of notification framing. Both mandates push the same principle: the agent does the synthesis work; the user gets the verdict aurally and the inventory visually.

### 2026.05.21 - Session 94 (morning) — Doc-Link Doctrine Reconciliation + Canonical `workflow/doc-viewer-links.md` (María)

**Persona**: María 🌸 (PIP session `d66169f2`; chorus mode active throughout). Tiberius 🌑 (Lupin session, persona) peer-confirmation via 2-DM `dm-tiberius` thread.

**Session purpose** (Rick's morning ask via voice): verify that doc-link doctrine is documented across all repos that planning-is-prompting is installed into — recurring malformed doc-links suggest the discipline isn't well-supported across the corpus.

**Audit findings** (original, before Tiberius's corrections):

1. Doc-link doctrine fragmented across 3 PIP workflow files (`claude-config-global.md`, `cosa-voice-integration.md`, `INSTALLATION-GUIDE.md`) with **two competing URL forms** in active circulation: (a) the legacy two-param form `/app/docs?path=<rel>&scope=<scope>` still taught in `claude-config-global.md` + Rick's global `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`, vs (b) the unified path-only form `/app/docs?path=<project>/<rel>` per `INSTALLATION-GUIDE.md` + project-CLAUDE.md citing the 2026-05-15 ratification. Contradiction is the likely root cause of malformed-link emissions.
2. No dedicated workflow document for doc-links — guidance is side-mentioned in 3 files, no canonical hub.
3. Of 7 registered scope repos at the time of audit, only 2 had `CLAUDE.md` and `.docview.yml` (lupin + planning-is-prompting); 5 (`cosa-voice`, `lupin-mobile`, `lookml`, `par-pacific`, `claude-plans`) had no CLAUDE.md at all.

**Tiberius's authoritative corrections** (4 sharpening adjustments folded into the canonical doc):

1. **`?scope=` is SILENTLY IGNORED, not 400'd** (per Lupin AC4b.7) — intentional to avoid breaking partial-migration test clients, BUT this makes consumers emit dead syntax indefinitely without learning. Purge is urgent rather than cosmetic.
2. **Audit missed `retail-ai-location-strategy`** in registered-scope enumeration — 8 scopes total, not 7.
3. **`docs` and `io` shorthand scopes for Lupin files are RETIRED** per Phase 4a — any `path=docs/...` returns HTTP 400 "Unknown project: 'docs'". Equally dead syntax requiring the same purge as form-(a).
4. **`get_session_info()` returns a single string `project` field**, not the old 4-field `doc_scope` dict envelope still taught in `claude-config-global.md` § Phase A hooks 4+5 AND Rick's global `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`. Another live teaching error requiring the same purge.

**Accomplishments**:

1. **New canonical hub** at `workflow/doc-viewer-links.md` (240+ lines) — agent-facing discipline doc covering: At-a-Glance contract table; canonical URL form + server-side resolution flow; abstract-only-never-message rule with TTS-hostility rationale; scope discovery at runtime (`get_session_info().project`) + dead-syntax purge for `doc_scope` dict; persona+scope COUPLED-at-Phase-A mandate; registered-scopes source-of-truth (defers to Lupin INI); `.docview.yml` whitelist-narrowing semantics; **Common Mistakes purge inventory** (7-row anti-pattern table); failure-mode hint with 4-step diagnostic for 404s; cross-references to Lupin CLAUDE.md, source-of-truth design doc, Phase A startup mandate, installer guidance, notification framing, cross-session comms.

2. **Three side-mention bounces** to point at the new canonical hub:
   - `workflow/claude-config-global.md` § Persona-First & Doc-Link Literacy — Phase A hooks 4+5 rewritten for single-string `project` field; legacy two-param URL example purged; dead-syntax purge paragraph added; full-spec pointer updated to canonical hub.
   - `workflow/INSTALLATION-GUIDE.md` § Doc Viewer Readiness — installer-relevant `.docview.yml` content preserved; inline URL-form duplication trimmed; prominent callout block added pointing at canonical hub.
   - `workflow/cosa-voice-integration.md` — § Voice Persona stale "not yet surfaced in `get_session_info()`" note fixed (it IS surfaced now); 2026-05-15 anchor-example URL syntax converted from two-param to path-only.

3. **Two Lupin-context follow-ups filed in TODO.md**:
   - Update Rick's `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` § DOCUMENT VIEWER LINKS to canonical form (form-(a) example purge; Phase A hooks updated to `project` single string; `docs`/`io` mention removed; cross-reference to canonical hub).
   - Backfill `CLAUDE.md` (thin, scope+hub-pointer minimum) into the 6 scope-registered repos that lack one (`cosa-voice`, `lupin-mobile`, `lookml`, `par-pacific`, `claude-plans`, `retail-ai-location-strategy`).

**Cross-session collaboration**: Tiberius confirmed all 3 audit findings + surfaced the 4 sharpening corrections via DM thread (qids `a1a5353a` → thread-reply via `commons_post` to `dm-tiberius`). Second DM (qid `591a8931`) on Rick's silent-ignore-default pushback was sent but Tiberius's reply hadn't arrived before Rick re-engaged with "he told me he's fine with everything, proceed" — Rick had sync'd with Tiberius directly via separate channel. Same DM-thread-as-design-doc pattern landed Step 0 + Step 9 doctrine in Session 93; doctrine reconfirmed under a third application.

**Process feedback captured**: mid-session, Rick flagged that the ping cadence (2 DMs to Tiberius + 2 multiple-choice prompts to María in rapid succession) was creating attention-demanding noise without code-or-doc moving. Saved as `feedback_ping_discipline_cross_session.md` in the project memory — rule: batch context-gathering into ONE comprehensive peer DM per topic, don't insert "ready to proceed?" check-ins with Rick between peer replies, sit silent during legitimate holds rather than asking what to do while waiting.

**Files Changed**:

| File | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `workflow/doc-viewer-links.md` | NEW | Canonical agent-facing discipline hub (~240 lines) |
| `workflow/claude-config-global.md` | modified | § Persona-First & Doc-Link Literacy — Phase A hooks 4+5 updated to single-string `project`; legacy form-(a) URL example purged; dead-syntax purge paragraph added; full-spec pointer updated |
| `workflow/INSTALLATION-GUIDE.md` | modified | § Doc Viewer Readiness — canonical-hub callout block added; URL-form duplication line trimmed to path-only with hub pointer |
| `workflow/cosa-voice-integration.md` | modified | § Voice Persona stale note fixed; 2026-05-15 anchor example URL converted to path-only |
| `TODO.md` | modified | 2 new Pending entries (Rick's global CLAUDE.md edit; 6-repo CLAUDE.md backfill) + Last-updated timestamp |
| `history.md` | modified | RESUME HERE update + this entry |
| `.claude-session.md` | modified | manifest section for session `d66169f2` (gitignored) |

**Pending**: top-3 TODO summary deferred to post-commit per Rick's session-sequencing directive. Rick said he has "something new" to hand off after commit.

### 2026.05.20 - Session 93 (fifth continuation, morning) — v1.1 Cascade-Doctrine Codification Pass + Executive Briefing for External Manager (María)

**Persona**: María 🌸 (PIP, session `ac2d05c0` continued from prior continuation; chorus mode active throughout). Tiberius 🌑 (Lupin, session `173c0b35`) reviewing per-artifact in parallel via `dm-maria` thread.

**Session purpose** (Rick's morning ask via voice): "Dig into your documentation and summarize highlights, accomplishments, surprises, and lessons learned from last night's Run 4 cascade. Include a list of improvements that we could make to both doctrine and implementation to roll lessons learned into our next cascade planning iteration." Plus a follow-on for an external-manager executive briefing with two mermaid diagrams + a dedicated doctrine-observer section.

**Accomplishments**:

1. **Run 4 retrospective + post-game** — Read history.md + TODO.md + design-doc §10.18 + observer-prep doc; composed a structured retrospective covering headlines (zero user touches, 90 min wall-clock, 17% shorter than Run 3 with two new doctrines on first application), 4 surprises (Step 9 dual-administer empirically additive; monotonic 38→33→21 stage timing pattern; failure mode #6 `signal-density-obscures-needle`; inverse density-vs-doctrine correlation), 4 lessons learned, 5 v1.1 doctrine candidates + 1 placeholder, and 5 implementation improvement candidates. Delivered to Rick via `notify()` with full abstract.

2. **María ↔ Tiberius bilateral retrospective DM thread** — Tiberius's strawman (qid `0cfea56f` response) was sharp; caught two methodological self-corrections I had missed (the phantom-lag-stripped artifact catch on §10.18.4 monotonic-timing data; the slot-vs-persona confound on §10.18.9 wisdom-vs-volume framing). Two rounds of structured exchange (DMs `0cfea56f` → `67ccf3f8` → `569eeba8`) converged 100% on: (a) 7 v1.1 doctrine candidates with locked fold-order positions 1-7 + 1 placeholder; (b) 4 pre-committed re-evaluation gates anchored to Runs 5/6/7; (c) 2 new candidates emerged from the DM thread itself (#6 Manager close-out self-audit sweep at Step 9 rubric Q#6; #7 Observer-probe-as-mitigation channel — standalone, not #5 extension, structural distinction single-loop vs double-loop).

3. **Codification pass executed solo** (per hub-spoke pattern; ~75 min wall-clock per prior Step 0 + Step 9 signatures) — drafted edits across 5 workflow files + design doc:
   - `workflow/plan-review-cascaded-defaults.md` — NEW §Cascade-execution observability config section (4 new INI keys: `heartbeat_daemon_kickoff_policy = dual_independent`, `observer_probe_cadence_default = 4`, `observer_probe_cadence_stage_0 = 8`, `observer_probe_cadence_stage_2 = 2`); 3 new `kind` enum values (`manager_self_audit_sweep`, `observer_probe_unblocked`, `multi_surface_footer_ratification`); config keys 28 → 32; new version-history entry
   - `workflow/plan-review-cascaded-common.md` — 7 distinct edits: §Manager System Prompt self-audit item 7 (post-cascade close-out sweep); NEW §Clarification Tier Vocabulary (T1/T2/T3/T4); NEW §Author-side Discipline Grep-sweep Checklist (6-pass routine pre-handoff self-check with 3 empirical anchors); §Heartbeat Handling extension for dual-independent daemon kickoff; NEW §Observer-mode Probe Protocol (dual-channel safety property; M:1 with heartbeat per-stage cadence); §Step 9 cold-context test rubric extended 5 → 6 questions + NEW §Manager close-out self-audit sweep sub-section with TODO.md filing template; NEW §Multi-surface Footer-ratification Close Protocol (7 surfaces, 7 cross-cascade empirical instances); new version-history entry
   - `workflow/plan-review-cascaded-personas.md` — Persona 1 Outputs gained `kind: manager_self_audit_sweep` artifact bullet; Persona 2.A point 14 AC-table sweep extended with Run-4 anchors #2 + #3 (cumulative anchor base now 5 instances across Runs 3+4); NEW Persona 6 (Doctrine Observer, optional) section; "Five Roles" framing gained optional-6th-role paragraph; new version-history entry
   - `workflow/plan-authoring-cascaded.md` + `workflow/plan-review-cascaded.md` — version-history-only entries pointing to canonical edits in common.md
   - `src/rnd/2026.05.17-cascaded-plan-review-pipeline.md` — NEW §10.18.12 Pre-committed re-evaluation gates section (Gate 1: Run 5/6 controlled-slot experiment; Gate 2: Run 7 forward-asymmetry re-evaluation; Gate 3: Run 7 `light_review_required` HARD-promotion; Gate 4: Run 5/6 failure-mode-#6 mitigation validation; anti-pattern gate-slippage explicitly forbidden without empirical-justification documentation)

4. **Executive briefing for Rick's external manager** — Drafted `src/rnd/executive-briefings/2026.05.20-cascaded-review-pipeline-executive-summary.md` (NEW subdirectory; ~7-min read; jargon-free; covers the full 4-run arc from concept validation through last night's fully-autonomous close). Rick approved + asked for two mermaid diagrams + a dedicated doctrine-observer section. Updated doc with: (a) NEW "Architecture: Roles and Information Flow" section between "How It Works Operationally" and "Quantitative Outcomes" containing Diagram A (roles + reporting relationships; color-coded — Developer yellow, Observer pink, Coordinator purple) and Diagram B (information + data flows; closed-loop showing how post-cascade retrospective feeds workflow refinements back into next iteration's pre-cascade reconnaissance); (b) NEW "How the Pipeline Self-Improves: The Doctrine Observer Role" section covering observer's real-time + post-cascade duties + 4 empirical contributions from Run 4 + two improvement surfaces framing (plan vs implementation) + load-bearing rationale. README.md updated with link to the briefing.

**Cross-repo coordination**: María ↔ Tiberius via 4 DMs on `dm-maria` (qids `0cfea56f` → `67ccf3f8` → `569eeba8` → `830f4833`) covering retrospective convergence + codification-pass artifact pointer-set for Tiberius's per-artifact review. Same DM-thread-as-design-doc pattern that landed Step 0 + Step 9; same ~75-min hub-spoke wall-clock signature.

**Methodological catches surfaced in retrospective** (worth documenting for future-self):

- **Phantom-lag-stripped artifact** (Tiberius's catch on §10.18.4): the "33 min effective" Stage-2 wall-clock excluded his 13-min phantom-lag — that's recovered telemetry, not real saving. The monotonic 38→33→21 pattern needs ≥3 phantom-lag-free cascades to claim as forward-asymmetry evidence. Gate 2 in §10.18.12 locks this re-evaluation at Run 7 with n=4 same-shape clean-sample minimum.
- **Slot-vs-persona confound** (Tiberius's catch on §10.18.9): the "wisdom-vs-volume curve" framing conflates persona effect with slot effect. Gate 1 locks the controlled-slot experiment (Krishna at position 3 in Run 5 or 6) to disambiguate.

Both catches came out of the structured DM retrospective itself — neither was surfaced by the unilateral close-of-cascade write-up. This is the empirical anchor for the dual-administrator discipline at Step 9 (Manager-self-audit + Observer-co-retrospective produces sharper methodology than either alone).

**Doctrine highlight — "Manager ad-hoc'd what should be codified" diagnostic empirically validated 3 times**: Step 9 omission post-Run-3 (Tiberius's 1,225-LOC synthesis improvisation); Step 0 omission post-Mr-Radio-onboarding (Tiberius's ~1500-word verbal brief); failure mode #6 + observer-probe candidate post-Run-4 (María's minute-13 probe being the actual mitigation, not theoretical safety net). The pattern is now formalized as §Manager System Prompt self-audit item 7 (post-cascade close-out sweep) → routine Step 9 rubric Q#6 → produces `kind: manager_self_audit_sweep` post → files candidates to TODO.md. The diagnostic accelerates the rate at which doctrine self-improves — meta-engine of the cascade's "self-improving" property.

**Pending state**:
- Tiberius review of the 5+1 codification artifacts (DM `830f4833`). Standing by for review-OK or structural-iteration ping.
- Rick's redline on the executive briefing before he forwards to his manager.
- Commit held until both above signals received.

### 2026.05.20 - Session 93 (fourth continuation, late evening) — Run 4 Phase 7a Cascade CLOSED — Step 0 + Step 9 Doctrine First-Application Validated STRONG (María)

**Persona**: María 🌸 (PIP, session `ac2d05c0`). Observer mode through full cascade; cascade-close-acknowledgment DM-thread closed with Tiberius 🌑.

**Cascade window**: 2026-05-20T01:55:34 → 03:30:47 UTC = **1h 30 min wall-clock**. Cascade-complete signal fired @ 03:30:47 UTC, posted by Tiberius (Manager) to commons topic `cascaded-prototype-input-plan`.

**The headline outcome**: **first cascade-run with zero user touches** — Rick AFK + volume-off + asleep for the duration per his explicit pre-cascade directive. T1/T2 silent execution = 100%, zero T3 escalations, zero T4 wake-ups. The Tier discipline doctrine works as designed under the explicit unavailable-user constraint; this is the cleanest cascade-close-protocol demonstration of the workflow's central value proposition (user-attention-cost minimization at the limit).

**Doctrine validation outcomes** (both load-bearing v1 retrofits validated on first application):

1. **Step 0 (Cascade Preparation) doctrine — STRONG empirical concurrence from 3 reviewers**:
   - Pre-cascade Recon doc (Tiberius's `14-phase7a-telemetry-pre-cascade-recon.md`) eliminated **6 browser-API archaeology items upstream** that would otherwise have spawned Stage-1 cycles.
   - Q→F→S→D recon shape was empirically clean across all 21 standing-memory items the self-audit table enumerated.
   - Three reviewers (Rachel, Krishna, Rio) each independently surfaced **Recon-Item-N notation references** in their stage outputs — direct evidence the recon artifact functioned as the cold-cast onboarding contract Step 0 doctrine specifies.
   - OTel package selection (Recon item §6.3, pre-resolved `@opentelemetry/api` vs `@grafana/faro-web-tracing` axis) was the highest-leverage single example: 4 minutes pre-cascade reading prevented a multi-turn Stage 1+2 user-escalation cycle.
   - Minor v2 candidate surfaced: Persona-conventions sub-section of Recon checklist not formalized (current cast seasoned so non-blocking).

2. **Step 9 (Implementation-Handoff Synthesis) doctrine — STRONG with empirical bonus (catalytic finding)**:
   - **The dual-administer cold-context test is ADDITIVE, not redundant.**
   - Tiberius's Manager self-administered cold-context test: named **3 friction points** in synthesis doc.
   - Krishna's 7-min cascade-participant external light-review: named **2 ADDITIONAL friction points** Tiberius's self-test missed:
     - **F-LR-1**: smoke test file name/path/scope drift between synthesis (`websocket_smoke/test_telemetry_handshake.py`) and design doc (`smoke/test_multiplexer_phase7a_smoke.py`).
     - **F-LR-2**: `auth/AuthManager.ts` canonical-directory drift (synthesis named `api/AuthManager.ts` vs design doc's `auth/AuthManager.ts`).
   - Both T1 line-edits applied in 1/1 cap-state revision turn = clean discipline.
   - **Implication for v1.1**: empirical bar for promoting `light_review_required = true` (current default) to HARD requirement may be met after Run 5+6 if this additive ratio holds.

**Cascade telemetry highlights**:

| Stage | Effective wall-clock | Active findings | Findings density |
|---|---|---|---|
| Step 0 light-review (pre-cascade) | ~5 min | 6/6 rubric pass | — |
| Stage 1 (Rachel, Usability/Reuse) | ~38 min | 3 active + 5 reuse confirms | 0.66/min on 444 LOC |
| Stage 2 (Krishna, Risk/Anti-pattern) | ~33 min effective (+13 min Manager phantom-lag) | 9 active + 1 cosmetic + 4 quibbles | 0.27/min (denser-grained) |
| Stage 3 (Rio, Ownership/Convention) | ~21 min effective | 4 active + 1 withdrawn + 1 cosmetic | 0.19/min |
| Manager synthesis pass | ~25 min | 1 synthesis doc | — |
| Step 9 light-review (Krishna) | ~7 min | 2 friction points (F-LR-1 + F-LR-2) + 1 candidate-6 placeholder | — |

**Monotonically-decreasing-stage-wall-clock pattern (38 → 33 → 21 min effective)** is the first empirical anchor for **cascade-learning-loop forward-asymmetry** as a first-order workflow asset. Hypothesis: downstream reviewers benefit from upstream stage outputs (compressed context, foreshadowed clusters, ratified vocabulary) in a way that accelerates the work even as substrate complexity stays constant. Worth charting across Runs 5+6+7 to confirm.

**Inverse density-vs-doctrine correlation observation**: Rio's lower findings-per-minute correlated with HIGHER doctrine-refinement contribution (multi-surface footer-ratification 7th-surface refinement landed in his stage). Krishna's contribution was the catalytic catch (Q-1..Q-4 doctrine-sweep pattern). Suggests a wisdom-vs-volume curve worth tracking.

**Cap utilization (final)**: 8 of 14 possible revision turns used = **57% net utilization**. 50%+ headroom preserved across every cap surface. No force-closes; no cap-saturation events.

**Failure mode #6 discovered (`signal-density-obscures-needle`)**:
- Manager-perceptual surface issue captured for `src/rnd/2026.05.17-cascaded-plan-review-pipeline.md` §10.14 failure-mode catalog.
- Symptom: Stage 2 Manager-perception 13-min phantom-lag — heartbeat-tick injections obscured peer-DM injections when system-reminder density was high. Manager continued working on Stage-1 close-out while Krishna's Stage-2 first-cycle output sat unread.
- Surfacing: María (Observer) probe at minute 13 cleared via `commons_who()` + `commons_read('coordination')`.
- 3 mitigation surfaces enumerated in Tiberius synthesis doc §5 candidate #3; primary recommendation = Manager-behavior proactive-read every N ticks (demonstrated effective in second half of run).

**v1.1 doctrine candidates surfaced** (5 promoted + 1 placeholder, full table in §10.18.8):
1. Heartbeat-daemon kickoff codification (Rick's catch from Run 4 prep).
2. 4-tier clarification doctrine (T1/T2/T3/T4) — demonstrated live in Stages 2+3.
3. Heartbeat-tick-vs-peer-DM signal-density mitigation (failure mode #6).
4. Author-side grep-sweep checklist (Persona 2.A point 14 empirical anchor #2; Krishna's Q-1..Q-4 catch).
5. Multi-surface footer-ratification close protocol with non-adjacent + synthesis-doc 7th-surface refinement (7 cross-cascade instances; Rio's catalytic catch).
6. Explicit closure-context markers `[CLOSURE: …]` (placeholder — Run 5+6 evidence-gathering needed).

**Observer-side additions** (María): observer-blind-spot (notify() to user invisible from observer's commons-only view); re-evaluate `light_review_required = true` (default) → HARD requirement after Run 5+6.

**Files Changed (this continuation segment)**:

| `TODO.md` | modified | v1.1 doctrine codification candidate item + Run-4-prep items moved to Completed |
| `.claude-session.md` | modified | manifest updates (gitignored) |

**Coordination + next steps**:
- v1.1 doctrine codification with Tiberius: pending his availability signal. Same hub-and-spoke pattern as Step 0 + Step 9 codification (common.md + personas.md + defaults.md co-edits).
- Push held per Rick's "no push necessary until end of day" directive — commits-only.
- Observer daemon: stood down on universal-step-zero tick after cascade-complete signal.
- Rick's morning post-run rap recap: composed in this entry + the §10.18 retrofit row; ready for his morning check-in.

**Doctrine meta-observation**: Run 4 strengthened the §10.11 verdict with a fourth-run empirical anchor. The cascade-learning-loop's "predict-measure-codify" pattern (§10.14 → §10.15 → §10.18) is itself now a 3-run pattern — the workflow has a meta-property of refining its own doctrine surface as it executes. Step 0 + Step 9 codification was the post-Run-3 + post-Mr-Radio-onboarding closure of the v1 design loop; Run 4 was the first cascade to ratify both doctrines empirically.

### 2026.05.20 - Session 93 (fourth continuation) — Run 4 Doctrine-Observer Prep (María)

**Persona**: María 🌸 (PIP, session `ac2d05c0`). Single-author prep work; coordination DM with Tiberius pending.

**Session purpose**: Per Rick's directive "document and checkpoint your work and prepare to coordinate with Tiberius for our fourth run." With Step 0 + Step 9 doctrine codified in the prior continuation, Run 4 (Phase 7a telemetry cascade) is the v1 empirical anchor for BOTH new doctrines. This prep work captures my observer-role checklist + telemetry-capture plan + coordination items for the upcoming Run 4 launch.

**Accomplishments**:

- **`src/rnd/2026.05.20-run-4-doctrine-observer-prep.md`** (NEW, ~150 lines) — Observer-role prep doc covering: (a) role + scope confirmation (doctrine consultant in observer mode, same shape as Run 3); (b) what to observe across Step 0 + Steps 1-8 + Step 9 telemetry; (c) communication discipline (notify cadence + DM patterns + heartbeat-daemon-relaunch instructions); (d) 5 open empirical questions Run 4 will help answer (project-agnostic criterion-6 generalization in telemetry domain + 18-min cap firing + pre-cascade Recon checklist effectiveness + etc.); (e) anticipated v2 doctrine candidates to watch for; (f) pre-launch coordination checklist; (g) post-Run-4 deliverables planned (§10.18 retrofit row + doctrine-candidate fold + Step-0+9 empirical-validation memo).

- **Session topic updated** to "Run 4 prep — Phase 7a cascade as Step 0 + Step 9 live-test" (was "Step 9 Synthesis-and-Handoff doctrine").

- **Multi-session manifest** updated with Checkpoint 4 (`0ae9aba`) + Checkpoint 5 (`bbb3e47`) + Checkpoint 6 (pending Run 4 prep) entries.

**Files Changed (this continuation segment)**:

| File | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `src/rnd/2026.05.20-run-4-doctrine-observer-prep.md` | NEW | Observer-role prep doc (~150 lines) |
| `history.md` | modified | this entry |
| `TODO.md` | modified | Run 4 prep items + pending observer-mode launch |
| `.claude-session.md` | modified | manifest updates (gitignored) |

**What's queued for Run 4 launch**:

- **Trigger**: Roscoe closes Phase 6c Node C (Manager Tiberius's signal)
- **Casting**: Mr Radio Author confirmed; reviewers TBD at launch per `persona_casting_strategy = user_assigns_at_launch`
- **My readiness**: observer-role checklist drafted; heartbeat-daemon launch command queued (`bash <lupin>/src/scripts/start-cascade-heartbeat.sh maria`); telemetry-capture plan documented
- **Tiberius coordination**: DM queued to confirm timing + casting; same DM-thread-as-design-doc pattern that landed Step 0 + Step 9

**Doctrine framing**: Run 4 is **the first live-test of an end-to-end-codified cascade workflow**. Step 0 + Steps 1-8 + Step 9 all formal-doctrine-shaped. The single most valuable telemetry signal will be: *did the doctrine eliminate the verbal-hand-holding pattern (Mr-Radio brief) + the ad-hoc-Manager-synthesis pattern (Tiberius's 1,225-LOC retrofit) that justified Step 0 + Step 9 in the first place?* If yes, the doctrine is empirically validated. If partially, the residual gaps become §10.18 doctrine candidates for the next pass.

### 2026.05.20 - Session 93 (third continuation) — Step 0 (Cascade Preparation) Doctrine (María + Tiberius)

**Persona**: María 🌸 (PIP, session `ac2d05c0`) — workflow-doc codification track. Tiberius 🌑 (Lupin, session `387b9201`) — requirements doc authoring track. Mr Radio 🦉 (Lupin, session `32a6e563`) — empirical anchor for the gap; cold cast member onboarding to Phase 7 slicing-manifest authoring.

**Session purpose**: Bridge the SECOND meta-doctrine gap Rick caught today (post-Step-9-ratification): the cascade workflow as documented has Steps 1-8 (execution) + Step 9 (synthesis-and-handoff, codified earlier today) — but **no Step 0** for the cascade-preparation phase that takes a raw design document and produces cascade-ready inputs. Tiberius had to verbally hand-hold Mr Radio through ~1500 words of tribal knowledge about cascade-input shape (slicing manifest pattern, deliverable conventions, standing doctrine memories, autonomous-vs-escalate boundary, cross-team coordination) when onboarding him for Phase 7. **Same omission-load-bearing pattern as Step 9**; same ad-hoc-by-Manager → codify-by-doctrine fix.

**The pattern (after both retrofits)**: Both ends of the cascade lifecycle had doctrine gaps; only the middle (Steps 1-8) was fully codified before today. Step 0 + Step 9 together close the workflow doctrine's end-to-end shape.

**Accomplishments (PIP-side)**:

- **`src/rnd/2026.05.20-step-0-cascade-preparation-doctrine.md`** (NEW, 399 lines, Tiberius-authored) — Pattern 3 requirements doc. 8 sections: motivation + diagnosis + Mr-Radio empirical anchor; 6-sub-step spec for authoring-cascade (0.1 input intake + 0.2 slicing manifest + 0.3 per-slice design docs + 0.4 Q-decision matrix + 0.5 pre-cascade ratification + 0.6 readiness gate); artifact specs; Manager-default authorship + `cascade_input_ready` state enum + cold-context test analog; light-review gate (6-criterion focused rubric, ~15-20 min reviewer-time, 1-revision-turn cap); pre-cascade Recon checklist (REQUIRED for state-flip); 7 open questions with Tiberius's leans (all resolved by María during codification).

- **`workflow/plan-authoring-cascaded.md`** (MOD, ~120 lines added, María-coded) — NEW §Step 0: Cascade Preparation section before §Step 0.0 (formerly the standalone Intent Capture, now sub-numbered to avoid the umbrella-clash). The pre-existing §Step 0.5: Dependency Map renumbered to §Step 0.7 to free Step 0.5 for the new pre-cascade-ratification sub-step. 6-sub-step authoring spec; Manager-default authorship; Step 0 + Step 9 lifecycle completion narrative; version-history entry.

- **`workflow/plan-review-cascaded.md`** (MOD, ~50 lines added, María-coded) — NEW §Step 0: Cascade Preparation section before §Step 1. Lighter 3-sub-step variant (0.1 input-plan intake + reviewability + 0.2 pre-cascade Recon checklist verification + 0.3 cascade-readiness gate). Same shared acceptance criteria via common.md. Version-history entry.

- **`workflow/plan-review-cascaded-common.md`** (MOD, ~100 lines added, María-coded) — NEW §Step 0 — Cascade Preparation (Shared Acceptance Criteria) subsection added before §Step 1: Resolve Effective Configuration. Cold-context test 5-question rubric; light-review gate 6-criterion focused rubric; 1-revision-turn cap on Manager response; pre-cascade Recon checklist REQUIRED for state-flip; `cascade_input_ready` state semantics + full cascade lifecycle state machine. Version-history entry.

- **`workflow/plan-review-cascaded-personas.md`** (MOD, ~10 lines added, María-coded) — Persona 1 (Manager) Outputs section extended with Step 0 cascade-preparation artifacts (4-artifact-type for authoring-cascade: slicing manifest + per-slice design docs + Q-decision matrix + pre-cascade Recon checklist; 1-artifact for review-cascade: pre-cascade Recon checklist). Version-history entry.

- **`workflow/plan-review-cascaded-defaults.md`** (MOD, ~30 lines added, María-coded) — `closure_action` enum gained `cascade_input_ready` (now 10 enum values; pre-Step-0 was 9). `kind` enumeration gained 2 new values (`step_0_light_review` + `cascade_input_ready`; total 13 kinds). NEW §Step 0 — Cascade Preparation config section with 3 keys (`preparer_authorship_policy`, `step_0_light_review_required`, `pre_cascade_recon_checklist_required`). Total config keys: 25 → 28. Version-history entry.

- **`src/rnd/2026.05.17-cascaded-plan-review-pipeline.md`** (MOD, ~90 lines added, María-coded) — NEW §10.17 "Step 0 retrofit — the cascade-preparation gap" anchoring the meta-lesson with Mr-Radio empirical evidence + pattern-recognition with Step 9 + full lifecycle state machine diagram + "this is the second load-bearing v1 retrofit, not v2 polish" framing.

**Cross-repo coordination**: María ↔ Tiberius via 4 DMs on `dm-maria` + `dm-tiberius`. Same DM-thread-as-design-doc collab cadence that worked for Step 9. Convergence speed: gap surfaced 01:13 UTC; requirements doc landed 01:24 UTC; codification commit landed shortly after. ~75 min wall-clock from problem to ratification-ready package.

**Doctrine highlight — the cascade workflow is doctrinally complete-shaped end-to-end**: with Step 0 codified, the workflow now covers `raw_design_received` → `cascade_input_ready` → `cascade_complete` → `implementation_handoff_ready` → `shipped` with explicit gates at each transition. Both ends have Manager-default authorship + cold-context test + light-review gate + state-flip + pre-cascade Recon checklist (Step 0) / cold-context test + light-review gate + state-flip + execution-plan handoff (Step 9). Three axes formally covered (input / execution / output); v2 polish remains incremental on top.

**Process insights worth capturing**:

- **The DM-thread-as-design-doc pattern is now load-bearing infrastructure for cross-session doctrine evolution.** Validated FOUR times in the past 48 hours: v2 polish bundle (Session 92), cascade-as-author doctrine (Session 92 third continuation), Step 9 (Session 93 second continuation), Step 0 (Session 93 third continuation). Same 4-DM cycle structure each time: propose → cross-strawman → close-on-divergences → requirements-doc-handoff-to-codification. ~1 hour wall-clock per cycle, single-or-zero user-attention asks per cycle.
- **Pattern recognition closes doctrine gaps in pairs**: Step 9 surfaced via Tiberius's post-cascade ad-hoc work; once codified, Tiberius's Mr-Radio brief surfaced the SYMMETRIC Step 0 gap. **The pattern of "Manager ad-hoc'd what should be codified" is itself a useful diagnostic** for finding doctrine gaps. Future doctrine work should ask "what is the Manager doing that isn't in the workflow doc?"
- **Both ends of a workflow lifecycle need doctrine**: codifying execution (Steps 1-8) without preparation (Step 0) and handoff (Step 9) leaves the workflow gated on Manager-tribal-knowledge. The pattern generalizes: any workflow that produces structured artifacts needs entry and exit codification, not just middle-mechanics.
- **Symmetric structure aids cross-doctrine consistency**: Step 0 and Step 9 share the same authorship pattern (Manager-default), the same gates (cold-context test + light-review + 1-revision-turn cap), the same state-flip pattern, the same artifact-spec template. Future workflow stages can inherit this scaffolding.

### 2026.05.19 - Session 93 day-summary — Per-Repo Preferred-Persona Env Var + §10.14 Run-3 Doctrine Fold + §10.15 Empirical Telemetry + Step 9 Synthesis-and-Handoff Doctrine (María + Tiberius)

**Personas**: María 🌸 (PIP, session `ac2d05c0`) — first session under the new `COSA_VOICE_PREFERRED_PERSONA__PLAN=María` env-var contract; Tiberius 🌑 (Lupin, session `387b9201`) — pre-existing session, no restart; Roscoe 🤠 (Lupin parallel) — Phase 6C implementation kicking off in the back half of the day.

**Day arc** (chronological):

1. **Restart pickup + env-var feature ship** (~17:23 UTC start). Rick exported `COSA_VOICE_PREFERRED_PERSONA__PLAN=María` and `__LUPIN=Tiberius` in his shell rc + restarted the PIP session — Rachel's slot closed, María opened. The PIP session inherited Rachel's morning work in the tree (env-var plan + workflow integration). María committed under narrative-attribution rollout per the plan's own §9 rule. Cross-repo paired with Tiberius's parallel Lupin commit `3bc7b9e` (allocator helper + router endpoint + 7 new unit tests, 49/49 green). The session that did the commit was itself the proof point: `get_session_info()` on Phase A startup returned `voice_persona.name = "maria"` deterministically. **PIP commit**: `2e423e1`.

2. **§10.14 Run-3 doctrine fold + §10.15 empirical telemetry** (~19:30 UTC). The morning's Phase 6C cascade Run 3 had closed at ~04:16 UTC with 9 doctrine items queued for Tiberius's manager-seat redline (plus 3 Rick-voice catches). María folded the 12+3 items into the canonical cascade workflow docs across 4 files: `plan-review-cascaded-common.md` got the new §Reviewer Reassignment + §Cascade-Learning-Loop Sub-patterns + closure_action enum expansion + self-audit item 6 + 18-min user-attention-block cap; `plan-review-cascaded-personas.md` got Persona 2.A point 14 (doctrine-sweep with 3 sub-patterns) + Persona 5 Stage-3 Cosmetic-Cluster Recognition; `plan-review-cascaded-defaults.md` got the worked-example tables + commons `kind` enumeration. Plus design doc §10.15 third-row empirical telemetry: **~37× count reduction** (75 input Q's → 2 user-touches; 3-4× better than the pre-experiment §10.14 prediction of ~10×); ~6× time reduction (under predicted ~15× due to the 14-min Mr-Radio threshold-deliberation — which became its own doctrine fix in the 18-min cap). **PIP commit**: `28e84c7`.

3. **Step 9 Synthesis-and-Handoff doctrine** (~22:00 UTC, post-Rick broadcast `d3a89a21`). Rick caught a load-bearing meta-gap: the cascade workflow ends at `cascade-complete signal` but that's NOT handoff-ready. Tiberius (in Run-3 post-cascade work) ad-hoc'd ~1,225 LOC of synthesis work; the implementer (Roscoe) still surfaced 2 cascade-design gaps in his first 30 min of pre-flight that a light-review would have caught. The fix: NEW Step 9 codified as a workflow stage between Step 8 and the cascade-shippable state. 3-artifact spec for authoring-cascade (synthesis doc + design-doc amendments + execution plan); 1-artifact spec for review-cascade (revision-handoff doc); Manager-default authorship; two acceptance gates (cold-context test self-administered + light-review by cascade-participant reviewer); new `implementation_handoff_ready` state. Designed entirely in a 4-DM thread between María and Tiberius, with **16-second posting delta between their convergent independent strawmen** — same diagnosis, same 3-artifact spec, same state-enum name, same Manager-default authorship. Requirements doc at `src/rnd/2026.05.19-step-9-synthesis-and-handoff-doctrine.md` (Tiberius-authored, 312 lines). **PIP commit**: `6a8084c`.

4. **Cross-repo Phase 6C consolidation** (parallel track, Tiberius). After cascade-complete, Tiberius authored the same 3-artifact pattern that Step 9 doctrine codifies: synthesis doc at `<lupin>/src/rnd/v0.1.7/.../11-phase6c-cascade-synthesis.md` (476 lines); parent design-doc amendments at `<lupin>/src/rnd/v0.1.7/.../10-phase6c-persona-focus-recorder-design.md` (status flipped to 🟢 CASCADE-RATIFIED); execution plan at `<lupin>/src/rnd/v0.1.7/.../12-phase6c-execution-plan.md` (749 lines, DAG-first per Roscoe's preference). Roscoe picked up Node D first; pre-flight surfaced 2 cascade-design gaps (the empirical anchor for Step 9's light-review gate). Node B closed with c8 100% gate green AND a smoke-test-caught cross-renderer DOM-replace-wipe bug (validates test-pyramid working as designed). **Lupin commit**: `3c870fb` (4 files, +1325/-16).

**The day's meta-pattern — DM-thread-as-design-doc, validated three times**:

- Run-3 v2 polish bundle (yesterday continued — same pattern)
- Run-3 cascade-as-author doctrine extension (yesterday late — same pattern)
- Step 9 Synthesis-and-Handoff doctrine (today — same pattern)

Each cycle: design-conversation in a DM thread → convergent-or-divergent strawmen exchange → requirements doc handoff → workflow-doc codification → commit. ~1-2 hours wall-clock per cycle, single-or-zero user-attention asks per cycle, doctrine output that survives across sessions. The pattern is now load-bearing infrastructure for cross-session doctrine evolution.

**Doctrinal note — narrative-attribution principle codified by execution**: Rick's broadcast (early morning) directing each persona to commit under their own name in their own repo, plus the env-var feature that makes that determinism possible at session-start, plus the Step 9 retrofit that ensures the cascade output is implementer-ready — these three threads together formalize the cross-session, cross-repo, cross-day narrative-attribution discipline. The git log + history.md as the canonical record of who-authored-what-in-which-repo is the load-bearing instrument; today's doctrine fold makes that instrument complete.

**Detail entries below** (in reverse chronological order — most recent at top): Step 9 doctrine → §10.14 redline + §10.15 telemetry → env-var feature ship. Plus session-92 detail entries from yesterday onwards.

### 2026.05.19 - Session 93 (second continuation) — Step 9 (Implementation-Handoff Synthesis) Doctrine (María + Tiberius)

**Persona**: María 🌸 (PIP, session `ac2d05c0`) — workflow-doc codification track. Tiberius 🌑 (Lupin, session `387b9201`) — requirements doc authoring track. Roscoe 🤠 (Lupin parallel) — Phase 6C implementation continuing through Node D / B during the meta-thread.

**Session purpose**: Bridge the gap Rick caught in broadcast `d3a89a21`: the `/plan-authoring-cascaded` workflow ends at `cascade-complete signal + post-cascade fold bundle filed` — but that's **not handoff-ready**. An implementer picking up cold faces synthesis-archeology because the cascade artifacts are spread across N section topic files + a pipeline summary + a parent design doc still in DRAFT state. Tiberius today (in Run-3 post-cascade work) ad-hoc'd ~1,225 LOC of synthesis-and-handoff work that wasn't in the workflow doctrine, and Roscoe still surfaced 2 cascade-design gaps in his first 30 min of pre-flight. Both empirical signals demonstrate that v1's done-defined was wrong. Rick's ask: design the doctrine that makes the NEXT cascade run produce a handoff-ready plan without a manual extra pass.

**Convergent independent drafts**: Tiberius and María each drafted framings of the gap within 16 seconds of each other (21:57:39 UTC + 21:57:55 UTC). Same diagnosis ("both omission AND unfinished; omission is load-bearing"); same 3-artifact spec for authoring-cascade (synthesis doc + parent design-doc amendments + execution plan); same state-enum name (`implementation_handoff_ready`); same Manager-default authorship. Differences resolved cleanly: "Step 9" wins over "Phase 6" for workflow-doc-numbering consistency; Manager-extension wins over new-Persona-6 (cast-cost stability); BOTH modes get a Step 9 with mode-specific artifact spec. The convergence is itself evidence that the doctrine framing is on solid ground.

**Sharpening added in iteration**: synthesis-light-review gate as a v1-required safety belt. Tiberius's manager-seat experience today (2 conditional-Recon gaps leaked into handoff package because the synthesizer was in "faithful synthesis" mode not "challenge cascade assumptions" mode) is the killer empirical anchor. **Synthesis is not packaging — it is a quality gate.**

**Accomplishments (PIP-side)**:

- **`src/rnd/2026.05.19-step-9-synthesis-and-handoff-doctrine.md`** (NEW, 312 lines, Tiberius-authored) — Pattern 3 (Feature Development) requirements doc. 7 sections: motivation + diagnosis + Run-3 empirical evidence; 3-artifact spec for authoring-cascade; 1-artifact spec for review-cascade; Manager-default authorship + `implementation_handoff_ready` state enum + cold-context test (option (a) self-administered); light-review gate spec with 5-criterion focused rubric + 1-revision-turn cap; 6 open questions with Tiberius's leans (all 6 resolved in DM iteration before codification started).

- **`workflow/plan-authoring-cascaded.md`** (MOD, +~140 lines, María-coded) — NEW §Step 9: Implementation-Handoff Synthesis section between Step 8 and Manager Behavior. 3-artifact spec with per-artifact required content + acceptance criteria. Step 9 closure flow (Manager produces → self-administers cold-context test → DMs light-reviewer → reviewer thumbs-up or 1-revision-turn fix → cascade flips to `implementation_handoff_ready`). Step 8 explicitly NOT cascade-done. Version-history entry.

- **`workflow/plan-review-cascaded.md`** (MOD, +~50 lines, María-coded) — NEW §Step 9: Revision-Handoff Synthesis section between Step 8 and Manager Behavior. 1-artifact spec (revision-handoff doc with 7 required sections including REQUIRED §6 doctrine candidates index). Shared closure flow per common.md. Step 8 explicitly NOT cascade-done. Version-history entry.

- **`workflow/plan-review-cascaded-common.md`** (MOD, +~80 lines, María-coded) — NEW §Step 9 — Synthesis & Handoff (Shared Acceptance Criteria) subsection between §Worker Acknowledgment Format and §Cascade-Learning-Loop Sub-patterns. Cold-context test 5-question rubric. Light-review gate with reviewer selection guidance + 5-criterion focused rubric + 1-revision-turn cap on Manager response. `implementation_handoff_ready` state semantics. Mode-specific artifact specs cross-linked to `plan-authoring-cascaded.md` §Step 9 / `plan-review-cascaded.md` §Step 9. Version-history entry.

- **`workflow/plan-review-cascaded-personas.md`** (MOD, +~10 lines, María-coded) — Persona 1 (Manager) Outputs section extended with Step 9 implementation-handoff artifacts (3-artifact for authoring; 1-artifact for review). Cross-links to playbook §Step 9 + common.md §Step 9. Version-history entry.

- **`workflow/plan-review-cascaded-defaults.md`** (MOD, +~50 lines, María-coded) — Three extensions:
  - `closure_action` enum: added `implementation_handoff_ready` (now 9 enum values)
  - `kind` enumeration: added `step_9_light_review` + `implementation_handoff_ready` (now 11 kinds)
  - NEW §Step 9 — Implementation-Handoff Synthesis config section with 3 keys: `synthesizer_authorship_policy = manager_default`, `light_review_required = true`, `cold_context_test_mode = self_administered`. Total config keys: 22 → 25.

- **`src/rnd/2026.05.17-cascaded-plan-review-pipeline.md`** (MOD, +~75 lines, María-coded) — NEW §10.16 "Step 9 retrofit — the synthesis-and-handoff gap" anchoring the meta-lesson. Subsections: empirical evidence (1,225 LOC Manager ad-hoc + 2 implementer pre-flight gaps); doctrine fix (Step 9 spec summary); load-bearing v1 retrofit framing.

**Cross-repo coordination**: María ↔ Tiberius via 4 DMs on `dm-tiberius` and `dm-maria`. DM thread served as the design conversation surface (per the cross-session DM doctrine validated in Session 90); no separate design document or commons topic needed. Roscoe (Phase 6C implementer) continued heads-down on Node D / Node B in parallel, not blocking on this meta-thread.

**Doctrine highlight — DM-as-design-doc validated AGAIN**: the synthesis-and-handoff doctrine was designed entirely in a 4-DM thread between María and Tiberius. Same pattern as Session 90 Cross-Session DM Doctrine, Session 92 v2 polish bundle, and Session 92 cascade-as-author extension. The 4-DM cycle structure: (1) propose; (2) cross-strawman; (3) close-on-divergences; (4) requirements-doc-handoff-to-codification. ~30-40 min wall-clock for the design phase; ~45-60 min for the codification phase; ~80 min total ratification-ready time vs the alternative of a separate design doc + multi-session review cycle.

**Process insights worth capturing**:

- **The omission framing is sharper than the unfinished framing**: "the doctrine doesn't have a phase for this" beats "we didn't finish it last night" because it forces a structural fix, not a one-time patch. Tiberius's "both, omission is load-bearing" formulation captures the asymmetry correctly: if the doctrine had a Step 9, the Manager would have done it; without one, the Manager either ad-hocs or skips. Codification beats memory.
- **Convergent independent drafts are a quality signal**: 16-second posting delta between Tiberius and María's framings (with all the major shape decisions matching) is empirical evidence that the diagnosis is on solid ground. The pattern is reusable: when 2 sessions need to design something together, have both draft strawmen independently before exchanging — convergent drafts ratify; divergent drafts surface the interesting design questions.
- **Light-review-as-blind-spot-corrector**: the Manager-solo-synthesis has a structural blind spot (cognitive frame from facilitating the cascade differs from cognitive frame for challenging cascade assumptions). The light-review gate is the empirical-evidence-driven correction. Cost: ~10-15 min reviewer-time + 1 revision turn cap on Manager response. Benefit: catches the conditional-Recon gaps the Manager-as-synthesizer carried forward verbatim.
- **Step 8 is NOT cascade-done — explicit doctrine statement**: making it explicit in both playbook docs (authoring + review) prevents the confusion that v1 created. Future readers see "Step 8 is the last step before Step 9" not "Step 8 is the done state."

### 2026.05.19 - Session 93 (continued) — §10.14 Run-3 Doctrine Fold + §10.15 Empirical Telemetry (María)

**Persona**: María 🌸 (PIP, session `ac2d05c0`) continuing from the env-var feature ship. Tiberius 🌑 (Lupin, session `387b9201`) running parallel Lupin-side track: Phase 6C cascade-synthesis + design-doc-update + code-execution-plan author.

**Session purpose**: Bucket B (§10.14 errata sweep) and Bucket C (§10 third-row telemetry) of the cascade-output triage. Tiberius proposed parallel tracks at ~19:04 UTC: he handles Lupin-side Phase 6C consolidation (cascade artifacts → working doc → design-doc amendment → code-execution-plan); I handle PIP-side §10.14 redline of the cascade workflow docs. Rick greenlit at ~19:06 UTC.

**The 12+3 doctrine items folded**:

Tiberius's 12 from `pipeline-summary-20260519` commons topic — (1) AC-table-doctrine-lag pattern (3 Run-3 instances; Persona 2.A point-14 codification); (2) Hard-verification-gate vs post-cascade-fold as new closure category; (3) Visible-text safety on CSS var fallbacks **[OUT-OF-SCOPE — Lupin design doc]**; (4) Symmetric-application discipline (writer + consumer); (5) Reviewer-reassignment-due-to-rate-limit closure category; (6) Manager `blocked_waiting_on_user` coordination signal; (7) Q-D1 `manager_unilateral_ratify_by_concurrence` formal closure category; (8) Cascade-learning-loop sub-patterns (3 patterns); (9) Rate-limit failure mode (5th); (10) Stage-3 cosmetic-cluster as systematic pattern-family; (11) ask_multiple_choice Path-B skip-restart cost **[OUT-OF-SCOPE — operational footnote]**; (12) 18-min user-attention-block tightening directive.

Plus 3 Rick-voice catches not in Tiberius's list — (A) Manager Reassignment Latitude (5-element doctrine); (B) Reassignment Bias Risk guardrail; (C) Mute-Channel Bypass for Manager-Escalation **[OUT-OF-SCOPE — Lupin/cosa-voice MCP feature request, filed in TODO.md]**.

**Net**: 12 items folded into PIP workflow docs; 3 filed as out-of-scope (CSS-var = Lupin; subprocess-restart = footnote-only; Mute-Channel = Lupin feature).

**Accomplishments (PIP-side, this continuation segment)**:

- **`workflow/plan-review-cascaded-common.md`** — NEW §Reviewer Reassignment (Manager Latitude 5-element doctrine + Bias Risk Guardrail with 3 mitigation options + Rate-Limit as 5th failure mode); NEW §Cascade-Learning-Loop Sub-patterns (forward-only-asymmetry + symmetric-application + context-aware-application); expanded `closure_action` enum (3 new values) + worked-example sub-table; Manager System Prompt self-audit item 6 (`blocked_waiting_on_user`); 18-min user-attention-block cap in §Escalation Taxonomy; version-history entry
- **`workflow/plan-review-cascaded-personas.md`** — Persona 2.A point 14 NEW (doctrine-sweep on revision-mechanism change with 3 sub-patterns: symmetric-application, context-aware-application, AC-table sweep); Persona 5 NEW §Stage-3 Cosmetic-Cluster Recognition sub-section; version-history entry
- **`workflow/plan-review-cascaded-defaults.md`** — `closure_action` enum expanded with 3 new values; NEW worked-example table for new values; NEW §Commons post `kind` enumeration (9 kinds: 6 pre-existing formalized + 3 new); version-history entry
- **`workflow/plan-authoring-cascaded.md`** + **`workflow/plan-review-cascaded.md`** — version-history bumps cross-referencing canonical edits in common.md (no content duplication — common.md is the canonical home post-extraction)
- **`src/rnd/2026.05.17-cascaded-plan-review-pipeline.md`** — NEW §10.15 Run-3 actuals (third row of comparison table). Empirical results: ~37× count reduction (75 input Q's → 2 user-touches; 3-4× better than §10.14 prediction of ~10×); ~6× time reduction (90 min → 16 min; underperformed predicted ~15× due to the 14-min Mr-Radio threshold-deliberation dominating actual time — codified as the 18-min user-attention-block cap). §10.11 verdict extended to reflect Run-3 empirical strengthening.

| `history.md` | modified | this entry |
| `TODO.md` | modified | Mute-Channel Bypass filed; redline marked complete |

**Cross-repo coordination**: 4 DMs on `dm-maria` and `dm-tiberius` covering pickup brief + Lupin commit ack + parallel-track proposal + ack-with-cross-reference-plan. No blockers; rendezvous on track.

**Process insights worth capturing**:

- **Common.md is the right canonical home for shared doctrine**: the §10.14 redline naturally landed almost entirely in common.md (15 doctrine-term hits) rather than in either sister playbook. Confirms the post-Run-2 common.md extraction was structurally right; future v3 consolidation can safely reduce review-cascaded.md to its review-specific bits without losing the shared edits.
- **Cluster-bundling beats per-item ratification at the redline level too**: 12+3 doctrine items folded in a single redline pass with a single rendezvous to Tiberius (vs. per-item ratification or per-item DMs). Same `manager-funnel-inverted-for-proposals-up` pattern from the v2 polish bundle, re-applied to doctrine integration work. ~60-90 min wall-clock for the full pass.
- **Empirical actuals strengthen the design doc's case more than predictions ever could**: §10.14 had pre-experiment predictions; §10.15 lands the actuals with a 3-4× over-performance on count reduction. The third row also surfaces a genuine learning (time-reduction underperformance) that became its own doctrine fix (18-min cap). The pattern of "predict, measure, codify the residual" is reusable for future cascade-driven workflow experiments.

### 2026.05.19 - Session 93 — Per-Repo Preferred-Persona Env Var: Feature Shipped (María)

**Persona**: María 🌸 (PIP, session `ac2d05c0`). First session under the new `COSA_VOICE_PREFERRED_PERSONA__PLAN=María` env-var contract (Rick exported the env vars in his shell rc + restarted the PIP session pre-commit per the plan's §9 narrative-rollout sequence). Tiberius 🌑 (Lupin, session `387b9201`) shipped the cross-repo cosa-voice allocator at commit `3bc7b9e` in parallel.

**Session purpose**: Ship the per-repo declarative-default-persona feature end-to-end and land the PIP-side artifacts with María on the commit so the git log narrative reads as the single canonical PIP author from this point forward. The whole feature is precisely the mechanism that makes this narrative-attribution pattern re-occur deterministically: once exported, the env var ensures every fresh session in a given repo claims the same persona, so future history.md entries + commits show a continuous voice across days rather than the random-allocation noise of pre-feature behavior.

**The feature**: Per-project declarative default persona via environment variable. Before today, opening a fresh Claude Code session in `<project>` would randomly allocate any unallocated persona — so day-over-day narrative continuity required typing `/plan-session-start <name>` every session. After today: export `COSA_VOICE_PREFERRED_PERSONA__<PROJECT_UPPER>` once in `~/.bashrc` / `~/.zshrc`, and every fresh session in that repo claims the preferred persona automatically. The allocator lives in cosa-voice (Lupin's leg); PIP's leg is the canonical workflow + slash-command + installation documentation.

**Rollout proof point**: María session `ac2d05c0` is the first session ever allocated via the env-var path (not random). `get_session_info()` on Phase A startup returned `voice_persona.name = "maria"` deterministically — the integration test passed without needing a separate smoke run.

**Accomplishments (PIP-side)**:

- **`src/rnd/2026.05.19-cosa-voice-preferred-persona-env-var.md`** (NEW, ~370 lines) — Plan doc. Pattern 3 (Feature Development). Motivation, naming pattern (`COSA_VOICE_PREFERRED_PERSONA__<PROJECT_UPPER>`), conflict behavior (notify-only fallback on held/invalid — no blocking, no queuing, no interactive prompt at hook time), implementation plan, test plan, rollout sequencing & commit discipline (§9 narrative-attribution rule), implementation status (§10 captures actual delivery shape — env-var orchestration landed at the router level, not in the helper module per §4.1's hypothesis, keeping the existing helper contract immutable). All four §8 decision points ratified: naming pattern + conflict behavior + notify delivery (option α inline) + `/clear` semantics (Path A locked: env var fires on FRESH allocation only; preserved across `/clear`).
- **`workflow/session-start.md`** (MOD, +209 / -2) — Workflow integration, two new Preliminaries:
  - **Preliminary -1: Preferred-Persona Env Var** (~80 lines) — declarative env-var path; conflict-behavior table (held / invalid-name / unset); relationship to Preliminary 0.5 (declarative-default vs interactive-per-session); `/clear` semantics Path A; anti-patterns
  - **Preliminary 0.5: Persona-Request Swap** (~140 lines) — interactive slash-command swap path; arg detection from `$ARGS`; atomic-swap flow with 200/409/422/500 response handling; interactive conflict-resolution pattern (notify + `ask_multiple_choice` capped at 3 alternatives); anti-patterns explicitly forbidden (silent fallback to random; mid-turn persona flip; `AskUserQuestion` in chorus mode)
  - Updated existing "Send Start Notification" Preliminary timing note to reference post-swap persona canonicality
- **`.claude/commands/plan-session-start.md`** (MOD, +28 / -7) — Slash-command shim v1.0 → 1.1: optional `[persona]` argument support via `$ARGS`; updated usage examples
- **`workflow/INSTALLATION-GUIDE.md`** (MOD) — New "Optional: Per-Repo Default Persona via Env Var" subsection under Session-Start Workflow with `~/.bashrc` example exports + cross-link to Preliminary -1 and the plan doc

**Files Changed (this session)**:

| File | Status at commit |
|---|---|
| `src/rnd/2026.05.19-cosa-voice-preferred-persona-env-var.md` | new |
| `workflow/session-start.md` | modified |
| `.claude/commands/plan-session-start.md` | modified |
| `workflow/INSTALLATION-GUIDE.md` | modified |
| `history.md` | modified |
| `TODO.md` | modified |

**Files Changed (outside this repo — Tiberius's parallel Lupin commit `3bc7b9e`)**:

- `src/cosa/rest/voice_persona_helpers.py` — new helper `pick_preferred_persona_from_env(project)`
- `src/cosa/rest/routers/voice_persona.py` (router) — new `preferred_persona_name` query param on `POST /api/cosa-voice/voice-persona/{sid}/allocate` with graceful-fallback semantics
- `src/lupin_cli/claude_code/hooks/register_session.py` — env-var read at hook time, threaded to allocate router
- `src/tests/unit/test_voice_persona_request.py` — +7 unit tests (42 → 49 total; zero regressions in 52-test helper suite)

**Cross-repo coordination**: María ↔ Tiberius via DMs on `dm-maria` (Tiberius's morning briefing at 17:28 + Lupin-commit ack at 17:30). Pool-key vs display-name routing gap surfaced (commons_send_to to "María" with diacritic returns recipient_resolution_error because the persona pool key is lowercase no-diacritic; workaround used lowercase "maria"); filed in TODO.md as a Lupin-side bug for the next Lupin session to fix at the resolver level.

**Doctrinal note — narrative-attribution principle (Rick, 2026-05-19)**: persona-per-repo MUST stay stable across sessions and across `/clear`. The git log's Co-Authored-By attribution is the single source of truth for "who is the canonical author of <repo>." Persona-hopping mid-flight breaks the ability to track initiatives through `git log` + history.md. The env-var feature shipped in this session is precisely the mechanism that makes the stability guarantee deterministic at session-start time — eliminating the per-session friction of slash-command persona requests for routine narrative continuity.

**Process insights worth capturing**:

- **Architectural divergence as plan-doc rigor**: §10.2 (router-level orchestration instead of helper-level per §4.1 pseudocode) is a model for how plan docs should age. The plan keeps the design hypothesis in §4 AND records the actual delivery shape in §10, with a "trust §10" pointer for future readers. Avoids the common failure mode where plan docs become misleading historical fiction after implementation.
- **End-to-end proof via the session itself**: María session `ac2d05c0` was the first allocation ever made via the env-var path. `get_session_info()` returning `voice_persona.name = "maria"` deterministically on Phase A startup is the integration-test pass — no separate smoke test needed for this round. Future deployment-time validation: confirm `__PLAN` and `__LUPIN` propagate through fresh-session bootstraps across days.

### 2026.05.19 - Session 92 (fourth continuation) — Run-3 Phase 6C Cascade COMPLETE + End-of-Evening Closeout (María + Tiberius + Sam)

**Persona**: María 🌸 (PIP, session `4ee3e0c1`) — doctrine consultant in observer mode driven by external heartbeat daemon (PID 615764). Tiberius 🌑 (Lupin, session `4e724860`) as Manager-coordinator throughout Run 3 + Lupin-side closeout. Sam 🎙️ (CoSA, session `b987b7b6`) joining for CoSA closeout per Mr. Rick's late-night addition to the coordination chain.

**Session continuation shape**: Phase 6C authoring-cascade Run 3 launched at 02:28 UTC; ran 108 min to cascade-complete at 04:16 UTC. María in pure observer mode with tick-based universal-step-zero (3-min cadence via external heartbeat daemon, second instance launched mid-cascade to address turn-based-CC limitation applying to consultant role too). Mr. Rick fatigued post-3am; authorized María + Tiberius + Sam to autonomously close out all three repos (PIP / Lupin / CoSA) with commit-only, no-push, no-backup, stretched-day LoC Delta semantics, and history-update protocols so pickup-tomorrow is friction-free.

**Run-3 Phase 6C cascade — final tally (per Tiberius's §8 pipeline summary)**:

- **Wall-clock**: 108 min (02:28 → 04:16 UTC); well under §10.14's 2-3 hr prediction
- **Sections**: 4/4 fully closed (A 6c-A modal, B 6c-B focus tray, C 6c-C audio recorder, D 6c-D conversation-mode pin); all cap-locked at 2/2 multi-draft rounds
- **Findings**: 43 total across all sections (11 A / 14 C / 9 D / 9 B); 39/43 verbatim-accept (91%) + 4 documented-not-revised (cap-preserved)
- **User-attention events**: 1 substantive escalation (Section C F2 foundational, ratified-yes) + 1 ask_yes_no for reviewer reassignment (Mr. Radio→Arnold) = **2 user-touches** vs §10.14's predicted 7-9 (3-4× better than prediction)
- **Manager-unilateral ratifications**: 1 (Q-D1 Path A by-concurrence)
- **Votes called**: 0 (all re-litigation closed via single-round verbatim accept)
- **Reviewer reassignment**: 1 (Mr. Radio rate-limited 80+ min on Section B Stage 1; Tiberius midstream-reassigned to Arnold per Mr. Rick's voice endorsement of manager-authority-margin)
- **Hard-verification-gate**: 1 introduced (Section B AC-B15 grep-gate supersedes post-cascade-fold pattern)
- **Cumulative-findings dividend** (per Rio's observation): 11 A → 14 C → 9 D — Section D's lower count validates **cascade-learning-loop as first-order workflow asset** (proactively-doctrine-loaded sections produce fewer findings)

**§10.14 errata queue grew to 9 items** for Tiberius's post-Run-3 manager-seat redline:

| # | Item | Source | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Persona 2.A point 14 — doctrine-sweep on ANY revision-mechanism change | Rio (Run-3) | queued |
| 2 | §6.4 phantom-probe instrumentation | Run-1+2 carry | queued |
| 3 | New §6.5 manager-side rate-limit decision branch | Run-3 | queued |
| 4 | §8 cascade-complete new status enum `partial_closed_rate_limit_block` | Run-3 | queued |
| 5 | Investigate why Run-3 tripped rate-limit (concurrent count vs Anthropic capacity) | Run-3 | queued |
| 6 | Manager posts `kind: "blocked_waiting_on_user"` for observer disambiguation | Tiberius (Run-3) | queued |
| 7 | Manager Reassignment Latitude (5-element doctrine; Rick voice catch) | Run-3 | **queued — Option B (Tiberius redline)** |
| 8 | Reassignment Bias Risk guardrail (single-reviewer-multi-stage; Rick catch) | Run-3 | queued |
| 9 | Mute-Channel Bypass for Manager-Escalation (Rick lesson — muting Tiberius cost 14 min) | Run-3 | queued |

Tiberius additionally surfaced 12 doctrine candidates from his manager-seat in the §8 pipeline summary; total post-Run-3 redline material is rich (the 9 above are a subset of the broader bundle).

**End-of-evening coordination (Mr. Rick gone to bed at ~04:14 UTC)**:

- Mr. Rick's directive: PIP + Lupin + CoSA each commit batches in their own repo; **commit-only — NO push, NO backup**; history.md updated; LoC Delta with stretched-day boundary `2026-05-18T00:00 → 2026-05-19T05:00`; pickup-tomorrow ready
- María (PIP) ↔ Tiberius (Lupin) coordination DM established same-playbook agreement at 04:15-04:16 UTC
- Sam (CoSA) added to chain at 04:17 UTC per Mr. Rick's late directive: sequencing is Lupin commit → Tiberius pings Sam → Sam runs CoSA ritual independently (addresses Tiberius's cosa-edit-vs-manage-git restriction)
- Sam acked playbook at 04:18:12 UTC; standing by for Tiberius's post-Lupin-commit ping

**Accomplishments (PIP-side, this continuation segment)**:

- **Observer-mode telemetry**: 26 ticks of universal-step-zero observation across the Run-3 cascade; 11 substantive notifies to Mr. Rick covering disk-state deltas, worker activity heatmap, stall-vs-block disambiguation, doctrine carry-item captures, and reassignment coordination
- **Doctrine catches** (Items #7, #8, #9 above): Manager Reassignment Latitude draft (5-element doctrine), Reassignment Bias Risk guardrail, Mute-Channel Bypass for Manager-Escalation — all queued for Tiberius's post-Run-3 manager-seat redline per Mr. Rick's Option B selection
- **End-of-evening closeout coordination**: DMs to Tiberius (4 substantive DMs) + Sam (1 onboarding DM) covering playbook, stretched-day timestamps, sequencing, and pickup-tomorrow contract
- **`history.md` updated** (this entry)
- **LoC Delta CSV regenerated** with stretched-day window (per stretched-day boundary)

**Files Changed (this continuation segment, planning-is-prompting only)**:

| File | Change | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `history.md` | MOD | This entry — Session 92 fourth continuation |
| `io/git-loc-delta/planning-is-prompting-wip-v0.1.3-2026.02.16-continued-development-loc-delta.csv` | MOD | Regenerated via `--branch` per session-end ritual |

**Files Changed (outside this repo — Lupin)**:

- Cascade section topic files (4): `<lupin>/io/commons/cascaded-prototype-phase-6c-section-{A,B,C,D}.md` — closed at 967/1426/1152/1080 lines respectively (Tiberius's repo to commit)
- `<lupin>/history.md` — Tiberius's Phase 6C cascade Run 3 entry (his repo to commit)

**Process insights worth capturing**:

- **Turn-based-CC limitation applies to consultant role**: María's mid-cascade observation gap (Mr. Rick's "How are you observing if your console shows no activity?" catch) forced launching a second heartbeat daemon instance for the consultant. Generalizes the doctrine: **ALL cascade CC roles need external scheduler ticks, not just Manager**.
- **Manager-authority-margin as positive signal**: Tiberius's midstream Mr. Radio→Arnold reassignment without user pre-ratification (only ratify-after-decision) was endorsed by Mr. Rick as "Nice midstream recalibration... glad that Tiberius had the latitude and the ability to improvise on the fly." Codified as §10.14 Errata Item #7 (Manager Reassignment Latitude doctrine).
- **Bias-risk guardrails as paired doctrine**: Item #7 (latitude) needs Item #8 (bias-risk guardrail) — when reassignment puts the same reviewer on multiple stages of the same section (Arnold doing both Stage 1 + Stage 2 on Section B), anchoring/echo-chamber/confirmation-bias risks need explicit acknowledgment + mitigation choice. Doctrine pair queued for Tiberius's manager-seat redline.
- **Mute-channel deadlock**: Item #9 — user-level mute on a critical-path persona (manager) creates a single point of failure when that persona needs to escalate. Mr. Rick muted Tiberius for chatter relief; Tiberius's urgent escalation request waited 14 min for time-out because urgent didn't bypass mute. Three doctrine candidates: (a) default rule never mute manager, (b) priority-threshold mute-bypass via separate channel, (c) tool feature request for `bypass_user_mute=true` flag.
- **Cross-repo closeout choreography**: PIP/Lupin/CoSA coordinated via DM-only with sequencing (Lupin→CoSA per CoSA-edit-vs-manage-git constraint). María maintains cross-repo coherence via stretched-day LoC Delta boundary (`2026-05-18T00:00 → 2026-05-19T05:00`) and shared playbook (commit-only, no-push, no-backup). Pattern generalizes to any multi-repo closeout where one persona can't manage another's git context.

**Reason this is a continuation segment, not a fresh session entry**: same calendar arc (May 18 evening into May 19 early morning); same persona (María); same session ID (`4ee3e0c1`); direct continuation of the Run-3 Phase 6C dispatch teed up by the third-continuation cascade-as-author doctrine extension entry.

**Cumulative Session 92 wall-clock**: ~17+ hours across four continuation segments. Productive cascade-doctrine-validation-and-extension arc.

**Pickup-tomorrow ready (for Mr. Rick)**:
1. PIP repo: 1 commit at end-of-evening (history.md + LoC Delta CSV); no push (manual when convenient)
2. Lupin repo: Tiberius's commit (his repo, his content); no push
3. CoSA repo: Sam's commit OR "CoSA clean, nothing to commit" confirmation
4. §10.14 errata sweep (9 items, with #6-9 from Run 3) awaits Tiberius's post-Run-3 manager-seat redline + María's incorporation pass
5. §10 third-row telemetry awaits María's write-up (predicted vs actual table for Run-3)
6. Phase 6C implementation plan now exists in commons section files (A/B/C/D) — ready for Rachel's pickup into a single consolidated implementation doc when Mr. Rick gives the next-step nod

### 2026.05.18 - Session 92 — checkpoint (María, `4ee3e0c1`) — IN PROGRESS

**Persona**: María 🌸 (cosa-voice session `4ee3e0c1`, voice id `kcQkGnn0HAT2JRDQ4Ljp`) — chorus mode, doctrine consultant role across two prototype runs. Tiberius 🌑 as Manager (`4e724860`); Mr. Radio 🦉 (Author), Rachel 🕊️ (Usability), Arnold 🪨 (Viability), Rio ⚡ (Ownership) as workers.

**Session shape**: 1 long arc spanning ~7 hours. Started as continuation of Session 91. Walked through doc-link infrastructure fix → 5 workflow doctrine updates → Run 1 prototype (partial, abandoned mid-cascade after 3 cross-section foundational escalations) → Run 1 postmortem (with Tiberius's collaborative review) → heartbeat-daemon spec + Tiberius's daemon-ship + smoke-test → Run 2 prototype (COMPLETE end-to-end, ~49 min wall-clock, 21 findings, 1 escalation, 100% severity-proposed match) → §10 findings memo into design doc → visual-contrast diagrams.

**Accomplishments (checkpoint scope)**:

- **Doc-link infrastructure**: `.docview.yml` at repo root (Tiberius's grouped template with `allowed_root_files` for TODO.md, history.md, README.md, CLAUDE.md, bug-fix-queue.md, CHANGELOG.md); PIP `CLAUDE.md` "Doc Viewer Scope" section rewritten with canonical URL form (`/app/docs?path=<scope>/<rel>`, legacy `?scope=` ignored); `workflow/INSTALLATION-GUIDE.md` gained "Doc Viewer Readiness" subsection under Prerequisites with full template + bounce-and-verify steps.

- **Ownership Reviewer rename** (Session 91 carryover): renamed "Testing Reviewer" → "Ownership Reviewer" across 3 files (personas + playbook + design doc); 13 surgical edits + 4 cleanup (Test-perspective subsection → Verification observability, stage-3 label, vote tally, `TestingPedant` → `OwnershipAuditor`); provenance paragraph rewritten; version history entries added; substantive design-doc correction (dropped spurious 4th "Test-perspective evaluation" phase that doesn't exist in `/plan-review`).

- **Run 1 cascaded prototype (partial)**: ran ~14:55-15:50 UTC with 5 sessions (Tiberius Manager + Mr. Radio Author + Rachel Usability + Arnold Viability + Rio Ownership) on synthesized toy email-verification plan. Surfaced 12 findings; 9 absorbed by manager; 3 cross-section foundational escalated (schema contradiction, AC mis-scoping, missing interface). Abandoned mid-cascade due to compound dormancy + read-truncation failure modes.

- **Run 1 postmortem** (`src/rnd/2026.05.18-cascaded-prototype-postmortem.md`): 3 failure modes documented (write truncation pre-existing, read-side truncation NEW, turn-based-CC limitation LOAD-BEARING), 11 operational lessons, 3-tier recommendations (cheap/medium/heavy), proposed rerun protocol. Tiberius's collaborative manager-side input doc (`postmortem-tiberius-input.md`) provided Q1-Q5 answers + 6 additional manager-seat lessons + 5 schema additions; folded into main postmortem before finalization.

- **5 workflow doctrine updates** (pre-Run-2 v2 doctrine tightening, all in `workflow/plan-review-cascaded.md` + `plan-review-cascaded-defaults.md`): (1) §6.4 Heartbeat REWRITTEN as external-scheduler-driven (acknowledges turn-based-CC limitation); (2) Manager System Prompt + Universal Step Zero + 5-step self-audit checklist; (3) Briefing template ack-format clarification ("acknowledge Manager's DM specifically, not doctrine consultant's") + dual-delivery doctrine (DM + topic post); (4) Manager-classification posts required at every stage-close (worker-facing audit trail); (5) Severity-tag metadata schema expanded with 6 fields (severity, cross_section, closure_action, parent_finding, rounds_used, votes_called) with two-stamp convention. `phantom_detection_mode` default flipped to `heartbeat_handling_via_external_scheduler`; legacy `heartbeat_ping` REMOVED.

- **Heartbeat daemon shipped (Tiberius)**: `<lupin>/src/scripts/cascade_heartbeat_scheduler.py` + wrapper `start-cascade-heartbeat.sh`. Python daemon chosen over `/schedule` skill (per-tick cost analysis: skill spawns CC session per tick = ~$0.50 over 30-min cascade; daemon = sub-second + zero per-tick cost). Spec adherence: zero divergence from postmortem §6.B (manager-only scope, 2-3 min active / 5+ idle, 3-strikes dead-man's-switch). Smoke-tested live + ran through Run 2 with zero phantoms. Cascade-complete signal via `kind: "cascade_complete"` on input-plan topic; daemon exits cleanly on next tick. Bug found + fixed mid-smoke: size-based new-content scoping (initial detection-by-grep matched historical Run-1 cascade_complete post).

- **Run 2 cascaded prototype (COMPLETE end-to-end)**: ran 19:12:30 → 20:03:30 UTC = 49m 18s. All 8 stages closed cleanly. 21 findings (12 cosmetic / 8 inconsistency / 1 foundational). 5 re-litigation rounds, ALL single-round verbatim accepts. 1 escalation (Section B Arnold F1 plan-decomposition gap, user-ratified `documented_for_telemetry`). 100% `severity_proposed` → manager-final match rate. 4 cross-section findings. 0 votes called, 0 phantoms detected. Pre-ack rate 0/4 (Lesson 5 fix HELD vs Run 1's 3/4). Detection-delay negligible (heartbeat daemon + universal-step-zero WORKED). Cascade value proposition VALIDATED.

- **§10 findings memo** (in design doc `src/rnd/2026.05.17-cascaded-plan-review-pipeline.md`): 12 sub-sections covering executive summary, both runs' detailed data, run-1-vs-run-2 deltas table, 3 failure modes with final status, 11 operational lessons with validation status, 4 new Run-2 findings (Findings 12-15: ask_multiple_choice default param missing, recommendation-as-headline doctrine fix, per-section message-count tracking gap, Convention 3 anti-pattern), top 5 actionable recommendations, v2 roadmap, references, verdict.

- **Visual-contrast diagrams** (§10.12 Visual contrast): two mermaid diagrams added — (a) OLD serial baseline showing user as sole gate / attention sink with every finding flowing through; (b) NEW cascade showing Manager filter, parallel sections, heartbeat daemon, doctrine consultant. Color-coded for sharp visual contrast. Demonstrates measured Run-2 outcome: 21 findings → 20 absorbed in-group → 1 escalated to user (vs old serial pattern where every finding consumes user attention).

- **v2 improvement bundle divide-and-conquer spec**: Mr. Rick directed me to chunk the 5 v2 improvements across the loaded team (Tiberius stays Manager-coordinator; the 4 workers become implementers). Drafted full spec for each item (scope, files, acceptance, effort, suggested casting); DM'd Tiberius for collaborative casting + dispatch. Implementation in flight at checkpoint time.

**Files Changed (this checkpoint, planning-is-prompting only)**:

| File | Change | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `.docview.yml` | NEW | Tiberius's grouped template at repo root |
| `CLAUDE.md` | Doc Viewer Scope section rewritten | new URL form + allowed_root_files enumerated |
| `workflow/INSTALLATION-GUIDE.md` | NEW Doc Viewer Readiness subsection under Prerequisites | |
| `workflow/plan-review-cascaded.md` | §6.4 REWRITTEN + Manager System Prompt updates + §Step 4 ack-format + §6.1 manager-classification + briefing dual-delivery + version history | doctrine bundle |
| `workflow/plan-review-cascaded-personas.md` | Ownership Reviewer rename + Test-perspective → Verification observability + provenance paragraph rewrite + version history | |
| `workflow/plan-review-cascaded-defaults.md` | NEW Severity-tag metadata schema (6 fields) + phantom_detection_mode default update + version history | |
| `src/rnd/2026.05.17-cascaded-plan-review-pipeline.md` | §10 findings memo (12 subsections incl. visual-contrast diagrams) + cascade-doc minor edits | |
| `src/rnd/2026.05.18-cascaded-prototype-postmortem.md` | NEW | Run 1 postmortem with Tiberius input folded in |
| `src/rnd/2026.05.18-cascaded-prototype-postmortem-tiberius-input.md` | NEW | Tiberius's manager-side companion input |
| `src/rnd/2026.05.18-toy-input-plan-email-verification.md` | NEW | Synthesized 2-section toy plan used for both runs |

**Files Changed (outside this repo — Lupin)**:
- `<lupin>/src/scripts/cascade_heartbeat_scheduler.py` (NEW — Tiberius's daemon)
- `<lupin>/src/scripts/start-cascade-heartbeat.sh` (NEW — wrapper)
- `<lupin>/src/cosa/config/docview_manifest.py` etc (Rio's truncation fix per his investigation)

**Process insights worth capturing**:

- **Iterative-correction-loop with peer session via DM thread** (continued from Session 90): Tiberius's manager-side input doc on the Run-1 postmortem added 6 lessons + 5 schema fields + the load-bearing turn-based-CC insight I missed. Run 2 succeeded because of joint-iteration on the Run-1 lessons. Same pattern that worked with Cross-Session DM Doctrine the day before.

- **Run-2-vs-Run-1 was a controlled experiment with shared fixture**: same toy plan, same casting, same workflow doctrine (with 5 fixes layered in). The deltas measured ARE the doctrine improvements' effects, not noise. Pre-ack rate 3/4 → 0/4 is the cleanest single-variable result.

- **Heartbeat-daemon-as-external-clock**: the load-bearing v2 insight from Run 1 was that CC sessions are turn-based. The architectural fix was an external scheduler ticking the manager. Run 2 proved this works in practice — zero phantoms, detection-delay negligible, daemon exits cleanly on cascade-complete signal. Generalizable pattern for any cascade-shaped CC workflow.

- **Divide-and-conquer is the right shape for v2 polish**: the 5 v2 improvements identified in §10 are all small (15 min to 2 hr each) and mostly independent. Distributing across the loaded team (Tiberius Manager + 4 workers in implementer role) lets us ship Run-3-ready in ~2-3 hours wall-clock vs sequential ~3-5 hours from a single session. Mr. Rick's directive on this was sharp.

**Checkpoint reason**: Mr. Rick requested mid-session checkpoint to push the §10 diagrams to GitHub for remote viewing. Session is NOT over — v2 improvement implementation is in flight; Run 3 follows after v2 complete.

---

### 2026.05.19 - Session 92 (third continuation) — Cascade-as-Author Doctrine Extension (María + Tiberius)

**Persona**: María 🌸 (cosa-voice session `4ee3e0c1`) — doctrine consultant continuing the v2 polish bundle ship into the cascade-as-author extension. Tiberius 🌑 as Manager-coordinator (still session `4e724860`). Workers (Mr. Radio, Rachel, Arnold, Rio) free since v2 bundle ratified at 23:09 UTC 2026-05-18; cascade-as-author doctrine work done by María + Tiberius alone per the agreed doc-spec coordination contract.

**Session continuation shape**: Mr. Rick raised a meta-design question post-dinner: stalled Phase 6C (multiplexer implementation planning) suffers from the EXACT serialized-Q-decision attention-killer pattern the cascade was built to replace. How would we adapt the cascade for plan AUTHORING (not just review)? Iterated with Tiberius via DM during dinner gap; converged on β sister-workflow shape (`/plan-authoring-cascaded`) with shared-doctrine extraction (`plan-review-cascaded-common.md`). Tiberius's hybrid framing — review-of-design + author-of-implementation-plan + cascade-resolve-Q-decisions — sharpened the proposal materially. Discovered Phase 6C design doc EXISTS, authored by Rachel 🕊️ 2026-05-12 (`10-phase6c-persona-focus-recorder-design.md`, 279 lines, 4 sub-features 6c-A/B/C/D, ~30 outstanding Q-decisions at stall point) — Rachel is the natural Author for the implementation-plan cascade (Mr. Rick's hint about "one of your four workers" lands cleanly). Mr. Rick ratified the full bundle (casting + sister workflow + Convention 6 + multi-draft + dep-map + goal-coverage matrix + cluster-bundled cascade-resolve) at ~01:13 UTC; handed me the doc-spec authoring; Tiberius drove pitch composition + ratification ask per Item #2 spoken-headline doctrine.

**Accomplishments (cascade-as-author doc-spec bundle)**:

- **§10.14 added to design doc** — pre-experiment cognitive-workload prediction for Run 3 / Phase 6C: serial baseline ~70-80 Q's to user vs cascade hybrid ~7-9 user-attention points = ~10× count reduction, ~15× attention-time reduction. Post-Run-3 actuals fold into third row of comparison table. 3 caveats documented (5% escalation rate is single-observation; hybrid framing trade-offs; Convention 6 contribution).

- **NEW `workflow/plan-authoring-cascaded.md`** sister workflow (~270 lines): two activation modes (pure authoring + hybrid design-to-implementation); Step 0 intent-capture (skip in hybrid); Step 0.5 dependency-map DAG with commons-topic posting + user-gate ratification; Step 5 extended with multi-draft author loop bounded by `author_revision_turn_cap = 2`; Step 6 extended with dependency-map maintenance protocol + goal-coverage matrix maintenance protocol; Phase 6C as canonical hybrid example with full casting + activation specs; new configuration keys table (7 authoring-specific defaults).

- **NEW `workflow/plan-review-cascaded-common.md`** shared-doctrine extraction (~330 lines, ~60% of original playbook): §Step 1 config resolution, §Step 3 user-approval gate pattern with spoken-headline contract, §Manager System Prompt with universal-step-zero + self-audit checklist + manager-funnel-both-directions doctrine, §Severity Classification with 6-field metadata schema, §Escalation Taxonomy with 7 triggers + cluster-bundling default, §DM-Subset Selection Heuristics with cluster-bundle rule, §Vote Mechanics, §Heartbeat Handling external-scheduler integration with daemon reference, §Briefing Delivery dual-pattern, §Worker Acknowledgment Format. Backwards-compat note: review-cascaded.md retains full text of shared sections for v1; future v3+ revisions should consolidate.

- **MOD `workflow/plan-review-cascaded.md`** — header note added naming sister workflow + flagging shared-doctrine extraction; version-history bump. No content removal (preserves v1 backwards-compat).

- **MOD `workflow/plan-review-cascaded-personas.md`** — TWO additions: (a) Convention 6 paragraph appended to Persona 5 (Ownership Reviewer) rubric — coverage-as-ownership-language for consuming projects with coverage mandates; activates auto when consuming project's CLAUDE.md has `## Coverage` section; cross-links to Persona 2 point 9. (b) NEW Persona 2.A (Authoring Author) section — inherits Persona 2 rubric verbatim (points 1-9) + 4 new self-check items (intent satisfaction; cross-section contract surface; multi-draft revision discipline; manager-divergence-check safeguard for hybrid mode); two worked examples (divergence-as-elaboration vs actual-divergence). Version-history bump.

- **MOD `src/rnd/2026.05.17-cascaded-plan-review-pipeline.md`** — §10.14 cognitive-workload prediction added (per above). Brings the §10 memo to 14 sub-sections total covering both Run 1 + Run 2 + the v2 polish bundle Lesson 12 + the Run-3 pre-experiment prediction.

- **Coordination pattern (cross-session)**: dinner-gap DM iteration produced the consolidated pitch (Tiberius's hybrid framing + my cognitive-workload math + casting reshape per Phase 6C find + Convention 6 extension). Tiberius drove the ratification ask per Item #2 spoken-headline doctrine; Mr. Rick voice-confirmed "yes" at ~01:13 UTC. Same divide-and-conquer + manager-funnel-inverted-for-proposals-up pattern that worked for the v2 polish bundle, re-applied to doctrine extension.

**Files Changed (this continuation segment, planning-is-prompting only)**:

| File | Change | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `workflow/plan-authoring-cascaded.md` | NEW | Sister workflow ~270 lines |
| `workflow/plan-review-cascaded-common.md` | NEW | Shared-doctrine extraction ~330 lines |
| `workflow/plan-review-cascaded.md` | MOD | Header note + version-history bump |
| `workflow/plan-review-cascaded-personas.md` | MOD | Convention 6 paragraph + NEW Persona 2.A + version-history bump |
| `src/rnd/2026.05.17-cascaded-plan-review-pipeline.md` | MOD | §10.14 cognitive-workload prediction |
| `history.md` | MOD | This entry |

**Files Changed (outside this repo)**: None this continuation segment. Pure PIP doctrine work.

**Process insights captured**:

- **Manager-funnel inverts both directions** — Lesson 12 from v2 polish bundle cycle (proposals-up bundling) re-applied successfully for the cascade-as-author doctrine ratification. Tiberius bundled the full β shape + casting + Convention 6 + multi-draft + dep-map + goal-coverage matrix + Phase 6C-specific Step-0 skip into a SINGLE `ask_yes_no` to Mr. Rick. Single user-attention point ratified the entire doctrine extension. Same pattern as the v2 polish bundle, validated again on a higher-stakes ratification.
- **Hybrid framing is the load-bearing simplification** — Tiberius's reframe from "pure authoring" to "hybrid review-of-design + author-of-implementation-plan + cascade-resolve-Q-decisions" reduced the new-doctrine surface significantly. Most of the cascade-as-review doctrine carries over verbatim; only Persona 2.A (Author) materially changes; reviewers 3/4/5 inherit their rubrics; manager system prompt gains a one-paragraph addendum.
- **Cross-session DM during dinner-gap is the right cadence for doctrine iteration** — both Run 2 postmortem cycle and the cascade-as-author doctrine cycle leveraged the same pattern: user-poses-question + AI-iterates-via-peer-DM-during-gap + AI-presents-consolidated-pitch-on-return. Saves multiple round-trips of user attention; user only weighs in on the SYNTHESIZED proposal, not the iteration deltas.
- **Doc-discovery as prep-work** — finding Rachel's existing Phase 6C design doc via `find` spelunk in Lupin's src/rnd materially reshaped the casting recommendation (Rachel as Author vs Mr. Radio cycling). The Phase 6C-specific shortcut (skip Step 0 because design + partitioning exist) only emerged because we read the actual artifact, not just talked about it abstractly. Pattern worth codifying: when adapting a workflow to a specific project case, READ the project's relevant artifacts before drafting the adaptation.

**Doc-spec ratification flow (per agreed contract)**:
1. María authors doc-spec (this entry's accomplishments) — DONE
2. María DMs Tiberius with topic-link to drafts when ready — NEXT
3. Tiberius fires consolidated ratification `ask_yes_no` to Mr. Rick per Item #2 doctrine
4. On Rick's yes: María commits to PIP per prep-don't-commit pattern; Mr. Rick fires `git push`
5. MCP restart (Mr. Rick's call when convenient) + Phase 6C cascade dispatch

**Cumulative Session 92 wall-clock so far**: ~14 hours across three continuation segments (cascade prototype Runs 1 + 2 + v2 polish bundle + cascade-as-author doctrine extension). Productive day.

### 2026.05.18 - Session 92 (continued) — V2 Polish Bundle (María + Tiberius + 4 workers)

**Persona**: María 🌸 (cosa-voice session `4ee3e0c1`) — doctrine consultant + documentation owner for PIP-side. Coordinated with Tiberius 🌑 (Manager) for cross-repo commit prep. Workers: Mr. Radio 🦉 (Item #4), Rachel 🕊️ (Item #3), Arnold 🪨 (Items #2 + #5), Rio ⚡ (Item #1).

**Session continuation shape**: Mr. Rick directed the 5 v2 polish improvements identified in postmortem §10.8 to be implemented by the loaded team via divide-and-conquer (Tiberius as Manager-coordinator; the 4 workers as implementers). Cross-repo work — PIP-side items (#2, #4, #5) for doctrine fixes; Lupin-side items (#1, #3) for code fixes (cosa-voice MCP + heartbeat daemon extension).

**Process pattern (new — folded into postmortem as Lesson 12)**: **manager-funnel inverted for proposals-up**. Workers posted proposals to a single commons topic; Tiberius aggregated all 5 into ONE bundled `ask_yes_no` ratification ask to Mr. Rick; Mr. Rick approved the bundle (vs per-proposal). Saved ~7 user-attention units vs per-proposal pattern. Meta-validation: Tiberius's second ratification ask led with the recommendation in spoken voice — Item #2's doctrine working in real-time before its codified implementation landed.

**v2 polish accomplishments (PIP-side, this session-continuation)**:

- **Item #2 (Arnold 🪨)** — Spoken-headline contract added to playbook §Escalation Taxonomy Template. All 7 trigger sub-sections gained `**Spoken headline template**: ...` line above the `**Abstract template**:` (label promotion). 6 ACs grep-verified. Doctrine fix for the Run-2 `neither: "what's your recommendation?"` symptom.
- **Item #5 (Arnold 🪨)** — Cluster-bundling promoted from informally-optional to playbook default. §6.2 paragraph + §DM-Subset Heuristics Rule 5 + worked-examples table row. Per Run-2 evidence (5 re-lit rounds all closed first-round verbatim using bundled DMs).
- **Item #4 (Mr. Radio 🦉)** — Persona 2 Author rubric point 9 added: `Convention 3 × Convention 4 interaction (tag-vs-deferred-infrastructure)`. Stage-0 pre-emption of an anti-pattern Pass 2 was repeatedly catching at re-litigation cost. Run 2 hit this 3× (A's AC2/OSQ6, B's AC2/OSQ4(a), B's AC4/OSQ4(b)).

**v2 polish accomplishments (Lupin-side, documented for cross-repo continuity)**:

- **Item #1 (Rio ⚡)** — `ask_multiple_choice` MCP tool gained `default` parameter (parallel to `ask_yes_no`'s existing behavior). Run 2 lost ~10 min when an AFK timeout returned `expired_no_default`. 13 new unit tests + 42/42 regression suite green. **Operational note**: MCP subprocess restart required for new behavior in active sessions (parallel to the truncation-fix episode earlier today).
- **Item #3 (Rachel 🕊️)** — Per-section message-count budget tracker bolted onto the cascade heartbeat daemon as side-task. ~90 lines daemon + ~140 lines new unit tests (5 passing). 2 new CLI args (`--budget-threshold` default 25; `--section-glob` default `cascaded-prototype-section-*.md`). Backward-compatible.

**Files Changed (this session-continuation, PIP-only)**:

| File | Change | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `workflow/plan-review-cascaded.md` | Items #2 + #5 doctrine (Arnold); version-history bump | 608→644 lines (+36 net) |
| `workflow/plan-review-cascaded-personas.md` | Item #4 rubric point 9 (Mr. Radio); version-history bump | rubric 8→9 items |
| `src/rnd/2026.05.17-cascaded-plan-review-pipeline.md` | §10.13 Lesson 12 added (manager-funnel inverted for proposals-up) + v2-bundle telemetry | +60 lines |
| `history.md` | This entry | +N |

**Files Changed (outside this repo — Lupin)**:

- `<lupin>/src/scripts/cascade_heartbeat_scheduler.py` — Item #3 (Rachel)
- `<lupin>/src/tests/unit/test_cascade_budget_tracker.py` — NEW (Rachel)
- Lupin cosa-voice MCP code (Item #1, Rio) — Tiberius prepping commit details

**Documentation process insights (folded into postmortem §10.13)**:

- **Manager-funnel inverts for proposals-up** — same save-user-attention principle as findings-up. Generalizable pattern beyond cascade scope.
- **Meta-validation in real time** — Tiberius's ratification ask demonstrated Item #2's doctrine BEFORE the codified implementation landed. The doctrine principle is correct independent of codified form.
- **Prep-don't-commit pattern under cross-repo bundles** — María + Tiberius prep history.md + commit messages + version-history bumps + worker sign-offs; Mr. Rick fires the actual `git commit` per CLAUDE.md `feedback_never_auto_commit_push.md`. Single user-attention point (ratification ask) authorizes both repos' commits.
- **Worker-free post-completion** — workers post `kind: v2_improvement_complete` entries to the commons topic with full diff/AC/design details. Topic IS the audit trail; commit messages cite it; no retrospective documentation from workers.

**Cross-repo commit coordination** (in progress at session-checkpoint time):
- María drafts PIP commit prep (this entry + version-history bumps + §10.13 + commit message) + worker sign-off pings (Arnold + Mr. Radio)
- Tiberius drafts Lupin commit prep + worker sign-off pings (Rio + Rachel)
- Tiberius fires consolidated ratification ask to Mr. Rick covering both repos
- On yes: each fires `git commit` with cross-referenced SHAs; Mr. Rick fires `git push` per repo

**Reason this is a continuation segment, not a fresh session entry**: same calendar date (2026.05.18); same persona (María); same session ID (`4ee3e0c1`); direct continuation of the v2 work that the original checkpoint entry teed up.

### 2026.05.17 - Session 91 | Cascaded Plan-Review Pipeline — Design + v1 Scaffolding (María)

**Persona**: María (cosa-voice session `3e0c6e15`, voice id `kcQkGnn0HAT2JRDQ4Ljp`, icon 🌸) — chorus mode, no peer sessions observed today.

**Session shape**: a single long arc with Mr. Rick. Started as `/p-is-p-00-start-here` for an exploratory design conversation about a novel cascaded multi-persona plan-review pipeline. Walked through 6 worries one-by-one (coordination cost, backflow protocol, manager calibration, phantom-session resilience, section-decomposition meta-plan, plus consensus-turn-cap rolled in) and 3 open design questions (architecture / prototype-scope / persona-casting) via `ask_multiple_choice` batches with my recommended defaults pre-filled. User overrode 4 defaults — most important caught mid-flow: workflow defaults must travel WITH the planning-is-prompting workflow (markdown), NOT live in `lupin-app.ini` (consumer runtime). Design doc rewritten to segregated-markdown-defaults pattern, implementation footprint simplified dramatically (no INI / splainer / `configuration_manager` interaction). Pivoted through `/p-is-p-01-planning` (Pattern 3, no Step 2 docs) into Phase A-E execution; 18 of 21 implementation tasks completed; Phase D (prototype run) needs ≥5 CC sessions + real-time user — deferred to a dedicated session.

**Accomplishments**:

- **Design conversation (pre-planning)**: walked through 6 worries + 3 open design questions, all via structured-UI multi-choice batches with my recommendations pre-flagged. Produced 22 configuration defaults, 3-tier severity taxonomy (cosmetic / inconsistency / foundational), 7-trigger escalation taxonomy.
- **Design doc serialized**: `src/rnd/2026.05.17-cascaded-plan-review-pipeline.md` — created at ~280 lines, then updated 7 times across the session as design evolved. Final doc covers problem statement + mermaid pipeline diagram, 8 design decisions, full 22-key defaults table with override mechanism, user-overrides table, phased v1/v2 implementation plan, open items, references.
- **4 user overrides flagged in design doc §5**: (a) `persona_activation = all_hot` (vs my proposed `hybrid`), (b) `budget_threshold = 25` (vs proposed `50`), (c) `phantom_reassignment = park_and_escalate` (vs `respawn` — platform reality: can't spawn new CC sessions), (d) **`prototype_scope ≥ 2 sections`** (vs `1` — parallelism is N≥2 by definition), and the structural correction (e) **config home = planning-is-prompting workflow** (vs `lupin-app.ini` — portability across consuming projects).
- **Phase A — 4 workflow files scaffolded** (~920 lines): `workflow/plan-review-cascaded-defaults.md` (22 keys × 7 categories with allowed-values discipline + 2-flavor override mechanism + worked resolution example); `workflow/plan-review-cascaded-personas.md` (5 persona briefs + 4 rubrics); `workflow/plan-review-cascaded.md` (manager's playbook — Steps 1-8 + facilitation duties); `.claude/commands/plan-review-cascaded.md` (slash command wrapper, dynamically picked up by Claude Code as soon as written).
- **Phase B — manager behavior spec** (~530 lines added to playbook §Manager Behavior): system prompt with 5 meta-rules, severity classification heuristics with worked examples per tier, escalation taxonomy template with all 7 triggers fully spelled out, DM-subset selection heuristics with 4 worked-example rows, vote mechanics spec (commons topic format + tally + tiebreaker), heartbeat ping protocol (cadence + timeout-interpretation table).
- **Phase C — reviewer rubric refinements** (4 rubrics in personas doc): refactored to align cleanly with existing `/plan-review` phases — usability/reuse → REUSE pre-pass, viability/gap → Pass 1 Fitness, testing → Pass 2 Ownership-Language Audit (NOT generic test coverage). Each rubric now includes `/plan-review` phase mapping, Conventions 1-5 grep responsibility, three-layer anchor stack awareness, concrete examples, anti-patterns. **Open flag**: "Testing Reviewer" role name kept as conversational shorthand from our discussion; rubric is actually Pass 2 Ownership-Language Audit. Rename pending user decision (would touch 3 files).
- **Phase E — doctrine integration**: README.md gets `[C.6]` Cascaded Plan Review entry in the workflow catalog; `workflow/plan-review.md` gets "For large plans (≥2 sections)" callout pointing to `/plan-review-cascaded` with the wrapper-around-`/plan-review` framing.
- **3 memories saved** at `~/.claude/projects/-mnt-DATA01-…/memory/`: `feedback_ask_via_structured_ui.md` (in speakerphone/chorus mode, ALL questions go through structured UI — even meta ones like "ready to move on?"); `feedback_workflow_defaults_travel_with_workflow.md` (planning-is-prompting workflow defaults must live in `workflow/` markdown, NEVER in a consumer-project runtime INI); `project_cascaded_plan_review_pipeline.md` (project context anchor for future sessions). MEMORY.md index updated.

**Files Changed (this commit, planning-is-prompting only)**:

| File | Change | Lines (est.) |
|---|---|---|
| `workflow/plan-review-cascaded-defaults.md` | NEW — 22 keys + 2-flavor override mechanism + worked example | +280 |
| `workflow/plan-review-cascaded-personas.md` | NEW — 5 personas + 4 refined rubrics + worked examples + anti-patterns | +390 |
| `workflow/plan-review-cascaded.md` | NEW — manager playbook + full §Manager Behavior spec | +820 |
| `.claude/commands/plan-review-cascaded.md` | NEW — slash command wrapper | +65 |
| `src/rnd/2026.05.17-cascaded-plan-review-pipeline.md` | NEW — design doc (created + updated 7 times across the session) | +400 |
| `README.md` | Added `[C.6]` Cascaded Plan Review entry to the workflow catalog | +1 / -1 |
| `workflow/plan-review.md` | Added "For large plans" callout pointing to `/plan-review-cascaded` | +2 |
| `history.md` | This entry | +N |
| `TODO.md` | Added Phase D (prototype) items + Testing-Reviewer role-name decision item | +N |

**Files Changed (outside this repo — memory work)**:

- `~/.claude/projects/-mnt-DATA01-include-www-deepily-ai-projects-planning-is-prompting/memory/feedback_ask_via_structured_ui.md` — new
- `~/.claude/projects/.../memory/feedback_workflow_defaults_travel_with_workflow.md` — new
- `~/.claude/projects/.../memory/project_cascaded_plan_review_pipeline.md` — new
- `~/.claude/projects/.../memory/MEMORY.md` — index updated with 3 new entries

**Deferred to dedicated session (Phase D — prototype run)**: pick a ≥2-section input plan (NOT the cascaded-pipeline plan itself — dogfooding loop risk); define telemetry hooks (intervention count, message count, wall-clock, per-stage breakdown); run prototype with 5 CC sessions in 5 tmux panes; baseline-compare against serial `/plan-review` on same input; write findings memo into design doc §10.

**Process insight worth capturing**: the structured-UI multi-choice batch pattern with my recommendations pre-flagged turned the design conversation into a high-throughput dialogue — user confirmed/overrode my picks rapidly without me having to defend each one. Several user overrides were sharper than my recommendations (especially `prototype_scope ≥ 2 sections` correcting my N=1 framing — parallelism cannot be validated on a single item; and the `lupin-app.ini` → `workflow/` correction that simplified the whole implementation). The "all questions go through the UI" feedback rule (saved as memory) was load-bearing — once it landed, the pacing got dramatically smoother.

### 2026.05.16 - Session 90 | Cross-Session DM Doctrine + Daily LoC Integration (Tiberius)

**Persona**: Tiberius (cosa-voice session `b714e138`, voice id `pNInz6obpgDQGcFmaJgB`, icon 🌑) — chorus mode with persona-aware DM routing live with María 🌸 (session `3c9fce51`) and broadcast-driven coordination with Mr. Rick.

**Session shape**: a single coherent arc — María shipped `cosa.repo.git_loc_delta` this morning; Mr. Rick asked me to wire it into the canonical session-end ritual so every repo gets a standardized daily LoC trace, then to give María directive-doctrine feedback on her MCP `instructions` payload expansion. The work spread across (a) workflow doc edits in this repo, (b) global `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` thin pointer, (c) live DM coordination with María via the now-fully-functional Phase 3 push-mode (which she debugged in real-time today after my first bug report), (d) upstream bug filings into Lupin's `bug-fix-queue.md`. Every cross-session round trip used the DM-as-mini-design-doc pattern that Mr. Rick has now asked us to summarize as a process artifact.

**Accomplishments**:

- **`cosa.repo.git_loc_delta` wired into session-end §6.2 as the new default daily LoC trace**:
  - Rewrote §6.2 from "Try the Lupin Branch Analyzer (Preferred Path)" → "Per-Day LoC Delta (Default Path)" — two-pass invocation (CSV side-effect + JSON for renderer), explicit `--save-output` from `git rev-parse --show-toplevel` to fix the cross-repo path defect I caught in smoke testing.
  - Added §6.2.alt "Optional: Rich Language Breakdown (`--rich`)" — demoted `run_branch_analyzer` to opt-in flag for the PR-narrative use case (preserves the language × code/comment/docstring breakdown when explicitly wanted).
  - Refreshed §6.4 render examples: new per-day table shape (Daily Totals + By Date × File Type), new spoken-headline brevity examples for the temporal-axis shape, doc-link callout to the persistent CSV.
  - Expanded §6.6 failure table (CSV-write failures, ModuleNotFoundError, `--rich` failure non-fatal handling, baseline failure non-fatal handling).
  - §6.7 cross-references updated to point at María's `git_loc_delta` README and R&D plan + my session-end-integration plan doc.
- **Live smoke discovery + filing**: invocation from `$LUPIN_ROOT/src` with `--repo-path` to an external repo (no `--save-output`) wrote the CSV to `$LUPIN_ROOT/io/` instead of the target repo. Root cause: `cu.get_project_root()` defaults to `LUPIN_ROOT`, independent of `--repo-path`. Workflow workaround applied (explicit `--save-output` from `git rev-parse --show-toplevel`); upstream fix recommendation filed.
- **`~/.claude/skills/codebase-analysis/SKILL.md` refresh** (out-of-repo but session work): added Decision Rule block ("Pick tool by question shape" — branch-total → `branch_analyzer`, per-day → `git_loc_delta`, repo composition → `directory_analyzer`); expanded trigger phrases with 10 per-day terms incl. "code analytics"; promoted Quick Reference to 3-column; added full `## Git LoC Delta` section with CLI args + Common Recipes + CSV schema; added `### GitLogLocDeltaAnalyzer` to Programmatic Usage; rewrote See Also.
- **`workflow/cross-session-communication.md` major refresh** — 2-surfaces → 3-surfaces model:
  - Added `commons_send_to` row to the Quick MCP tool reference; updated Phase 3 push-mode status to shipped.
  - **NEW §1.5 Directed messaging (DM) — mechanics, threading, and receipt**: §1.5.1 sending (with result-shape table for `push_mode_active` / `dm_dispatched` / `register_skip_reason`), §1.5.2 receiving (with receipt etiquette mirroring the user-prompt-acknowledgment rule), §1.5.3 threading (with the "replies live on the asker's DM topic, not addressee's" convention), §1.5.4 DM-vs-broadcast-vs-topic-post choice-of-channel.
  - **NEW §6.5 Cross-session collaboration patterns**: §6.5.1 bug-filing pattern with mermaid-diagrammed double-channel flow (DM + durable queue), §6.5.2 paired complementary-surface collaboration (the MCP-docs-vs-doctrine-docs pattern), §6.5.3 Persona-First Mandate compliance under chorus.
  - §7 follow-ups table flipped from "out of scope here" framing to a status table reflecting Lupin commit `f4e0370` (Phase 3 push-mode ✅ SHIPPED, DM extension ✅ SHIPPED, FunctionTool fix ✅ FIXED, `register_skip_reason` ✅ SHIPPED, tier-markers + `instructions` payload 🟡 IN PROGRESS).
  - Version history bumped 2026-05-16.
- **`~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` (global) — new `## CROSS-SESSION COMMUNICATION` section** — deliberately thin per María's 5-layer doc-architecture framework. Quick-decision-rule table + the attention-demanding-mode visibility MANDATE from §6 of the doctrine + pointers to (a) planning-is-prompting deep doctrine, (b) MCP `instructions` for cosa-voice specifics. **No MCP-specific duplication** — the MCP `instructions` payload (María's lane) carries cosa-voice-specific protocol; CLAUDE.md just orients sessions to the existence of cross-session-comms shape and where to look.
- **Plan doc serialized**: `src/rnd/2026.05.16-git-loc-delta-session-end-integration.md` — 9 sections covering context (sister-tool framing, not v2-vs-v1), affected files, plan of action, sample outputs, acceptance criteria, risk/rollback, execution order, open questions, and §9 upstream-bug discovery with suggested fix.
- **Upstream Lupin bug filings (both fixed by María within 4 min of receipt, via commit `f4e0370`)**:
  - **Bug 1**: `run_git_loc_delta` default `--save-output` rooted at `LUPIN_ROOT` instead of `--repo-path`. María's fix uses `git rev-parse --show-toplevel` from `--repo-path`. 3 new cross-target regression unit tests added.
  - **Bug 2**: `commons_send_to` calling `@mcp.tool`-decorated `commons_ask_async` by name (returns `FunctionTool` object, not callable). María's fix: refactored both wrappers to call a shared private `_commons_ask_async_dispatch()` helper.
  - Plus 2 adjacent fixes she folded in: API key swap to canonical `du.get_api_key("notification-api-claude-code-dev")` (F1), and `register_skip_reason` observability for silent push-mode failures (F3).
- **End-to-end push-mode verification live**: after Mr. Rick bounced MCP subprocesses to pick up María's fixes, sent a verification DM via `commons_send_to`. Result returned `{push_mode_active: true, dm_dispatched: true}`. María's reply DM arrived as a `<system-reminder>` injection (not just a topic-poll discovery) — Phase 3 push-back-to-asker watcher worked end-to-end. First fully-verified post-fix DM round-trip.
- **Co-reviewed María's MCP `instructions` payload draft** (5 questions, ranked by impact): flagged one real dependency issue (Speakerphone + VPSA sections describe USING state that Startup Protocol explains OBTAINING — currently in wrong order; suggested forward-pointer fix); endorsed her tier-marker formulation; suggested one addition to the 5 failure-mode patterns (persona-allocation cache staleness); confirmed all 6 cross-reference pointers map to my refreshed doctrine doc; identified one gap in receipt etiquette (loop-avoidance step + sender-mailbox convention explicit).
- **Discovered + filed-as-DM 2 new failure modes during the cross-session work**:
  - **Topic-name case fragmentation**: `commons_send_to` does `f"dm-{recipient}"` literally, so `recipient="Tiberius"` → `dm-Tiberius` while `recipient="tiberius"` → `dm-tiberius`. Two separate files on disk, silent message loss between case variants. María agreed to converge on lowercase + file as follow-up.
  - **System-reminder payload truncation on push-injection**: long DM bodies appear truncated in the receiving session's view even when the full body is correctly written to the topic file on disk. Mitigation Claude callers should learn: always `commons_read` the topic to fetch canonical body; don't trust the system-reminder excerpt.

**Files Changed (this commit, planning-is-prompting only)**:

| File | Change | Lines (est.) |
|---|---|---|
| `workflow/cross-session-communication.md` | Major refresh: 2→3 surfaces, new §1.5 (DM), new §6.5 (patterns), §7 status table, version history | +164 / -28 |
| `workflow/session-end.md` | §6.2 rewrite (git_loc_delta default) + §6.2.alt (--rich) + §6.4 render examples + §6.6 failure table + §6.7 cross-refs | +182 / -43 |
| `src/rnd/2026.05.16-git-loc-delta-session-end-integration.md` | NEW (plan doc + §9 upstream bug) | +218 |
| `io/git-loc-delta/planning-is-prompting-wip-v0.1.3-...-loc-delta.csv` | NEW (smoke artifact + first real session-end LoC trace for this repo) | 20 rows |
| `history.md` | This entry | +N |
| `TODO.md` | Pending items for joint summary doc + DM bug-fix follow-ups | +N |
| `.claude-session.md` | My session section + touched files | +N |

**Files Changed (outside this repo — work performed but committed elsewhere)**:

- `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` — new `## CROSS-SESSION COMMUNICATION` section
- `~/.claude/skills/codebase-analysis/SKILL.md` — Decision Rule + expanded triggers + 3-col quick-ref + new git_loc_delta section + GitLogLocDeltaAnalyzer programmatic + See Also
- `<lupin>/bug-fix-queue.md` — two new entries at top of `### Queued` (both since marked fixed by María)

**Plan**: `src/rnd/2026.05.16-git-loc-delta-session-end-integration.md` — status 🟢 IMPLEMENTED + §9 upstream-bug-report (resolved by María in `f4e0370`).

**Key insights**:

- **5-layer doc architecture** (María's framing, sharpened jointly): global `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` carries MCP-agnostic doctrine; project `<repo>/CLAUDE.md` carries project-specific doctrine; MCP `instructions` payload carries cosa-voice-specific protocol (loaded only when this MCP is connected); per-tool docstrings carry the invocation contract at the call site; per-turn `<system-reminder>` rider carries state-dependent obligations. Each layer has one job; no duplication across layers. This is why my CLAUDE.md addition stayed deliberately thin.
- **Iterative correction loop pattern**: across today's María ↔ Tiberius DM thread, multiple correction cycles produced sharper output than either session would have produced alone. Examples: my initial 3-layer doc model → María's 5-layer model (her sharpening); my "tier markers + examples + failure hints" prioritization for per-tool docstrings → María's commit landed exactly those (joint convergence); María's draft ordering → my dependency-issue flag (Speakerphone + VPSA before Startup Protocol) → forward-pointer fix proposed (correction). The DM-thread-as-mini-design-doc is a viable pattern for cross-session architectural alignment. Mr. Rick has asked us to capture this as a process artifact + add a README pointer to a summary doc — next-session work, deferred to TODO.md.
- **Cross-session bug-filing pattern works under failure**: the DM + durable-queue double-channel was robust to today's push-mode being broken (my initial DM to María had `push_mode_active: false`; the bug-fix-queue.md entry was the durable backup that ensured she'd see the report). After she fixed push-mode, subsequent DMs landed via injection. Both channels useful; pattern resilient.
- **Sister tool, not replacement**: `git_loc_delta` + `branch_analyzer` answer different questions (per-day temporal vs branch-total language-breakdown). The hybrid integration into §6.2 preserves both — daily CSV trace as default, opt-in rich language breakdown via `--rich`. Avoid framing new tools as v2-of-old when they answer a different question.
- **Architectural insight rule**: when a peer's framework is sharper than yours, fold theirs in even if it changes your previously-planned work. María's 5-layer model meant I had to scope-down my originally-planned global CLAUDE.md cross-session section to a thin pointer (from ~80 LOC to ~15 LOC). Worth the architectural cleanliness.

**Cross-session collaboration log (DM thread highlights)**:

| Time (UTC) | From → To | Question / Action | Outcome |
|---|---|---|---|
| 20:14 | María → Tiberius | Module intro DM (pre-issue, asking design feedback) | Discovered late due to case-fragmentation bug |
| 20:25 | Tiberius → María | Bug report: cross-repo CSV path defect | Push failed (`push_mode_active: false` — pre-fix code path) |
| 20:30 | Tiberius → Lupin queue | Durable backup bug entry | Active record regardless of push |
| 21:00 | María → Tiberius | "Both fixes shipped" via push-injection | First end-to-end-verified DM after F1+F2 fix |
| 21:09 | Tiberius → María | Verification + cross-repo CSV path fix confirmed | Confirmed by independent re-run |
| 22:14 | Tiberius → María | Doc-architecture proposal (3-layer model) | María sharpened to 5-layer |
| 22:17 | María → Tiberius | 5-layer framework counter-proposal | Tiberius endorsed; scope adjusted |
| 22:19 | María → Tiberius | Framework converged | Sequencing agreed |
| 22:21 | María → Tiberius | Doctrine refresh = cross-ref target confirmed | Lock-in |
| 23:35 | María → Tiberius | Instructions payload draft for review | 5 Q&A feedback dispatched |
| 00:18 | Tiberius → María | Substantive review (all 5 Qs) | Initially perceived truncated; verified in-place |
| 00:19–00:23 | María ↔ Tiberius | Truncation debate | Resolved: file is correct, view-side anomaly |

This collaboration log itself is the artifact Mr. Rick is asking us to summarize for the README pointer — DM thread as mini design doc, iterative correction loop, paired complementary-surface work. Joint summary doc deferred to next session (TODO.md).

**Persona**: Rachel (cosa-voice session `02f528ee`, voice id `21m00Tcm4TlvDq8ikWAM`, icon 🕊️) — chorus mode, speakerphone-driven conversation with Mr. Rick.

**Problem framed by Mr. Rick (voice, this session)**: Rio's Session 88 wrap-up summary verbalized Pass 2 of the plan-review workflow as *"what attacks does this enable, path traversal, manifest tampering, Unicode bypass"* — every example an OWASP threat-model category, none of them an ownership-language concern. Mr. Rick called the drift verbatim: *"that last pass was not supposed to be harkening the software against adversarial attacks. It was supposed to be an adversarial approach to finding gaps in the automation of testing... that binary check for who implements the AI or the user?"* Investigation confirmed: the **canonical doctrine has always been correct** (Pass 2 = ownership-language audit / executor-tagging / "user is never a tester"), and **the drift lived purely in session-level confabulation**. The word *adversarial* in software English defaults to attacker-mindset semantics, and Pass 2's prompt body used "hostile outsider" as a stance metaphor — both reinforcing the wrong reading. Mr. Rick's call: **eliminate the word entirely**.

**Accomplishments**:

- **Plan serialized to `src/rnd/2026.05.15-plan-review-rename-drop-adversarial.md`** per documentation-first protocol BEFORE any code/doc edits. 9 sections + status log covering problem, diagnosis (three reinforcing failure modes), nomenclature options considered, scope (6 live files + 44 occurrences), 6 phases, risks, approval checklist with §7 open sub-questions.
- **Two decisions locked at §7 approval gate** (Mr. Rick, voice):
  - **OSQ1**: NO adjective in title. Pass 2 renamed to **`Pass 2: Ownership-Language Audit`** (drops "Adversarial" entirely; "Audit" carries the auditor-stance weight without OWASP baggage).
  - **OSQ2**: HARD BREAK on slash-command flag. `--from=adversarial` retired with NO backward-compat alias. Old scripts/aliases fail loudly.
- **6 live files patched, 49 occurrences renamed**:

| File | Adversarial occurrences before | After (intentional rename-callouts only) |
|---|---|---|
| `workflow/plan-review.md` | 21 | 7 (rename-callout text + Lupin filename ref) |
| `workflow/INSTALLATION-GUIDE.md` | 10 | 3 (rename-callout text) |
| `.claude/commands/plan-review.md` | 8 | 2 (rename-callout text) |
| `workflow/installation-wizard.md` | 5 (post-fix discovery — initially missed in scope grep) | 3 (rename-callout text) |
| `workflow/p-is-p-02-documenting-the-implementation.md` | 2 | 0 |
| `workflow/p-is-p-00-start-here.md` | 1 | 0 (mermaid label updated) |
| `README.md` | 2 | 1 (rename-callout text) |

- **Hooks landed in canonical hub `workflow/plan-review.md`**:
  - Doc title: `Plan Review (Fitness + Adversarial Gate)` → `Plan Review (Fitness + Ownership Gate)`.
  - NEW top-of-doc disambiguation banner sibling to SEQUENTIAL EXECUTION MANDATE: "**⚠️ NOT A SECURITY REVIEW**: Pass 2 (Ownership-Language Audit) hunts ownership-language gaps and test-execution hand-offs — NOT a software-security review, threat model, or OWASP-style attack-surface audit. If you find yourself flagging path-traversal, manifest-tampering, Unicode-bypass, input-sanitization, or attack-surface findings, you are running the wrong pass."
  - §3 title: `Fitness Before Adversarial — and Strictly Sequential` → `Fitness Before Ownership-Audit — and Strictly Sequential`.
  - §8 section title: `Pass 2: Adversarial Review (Ownership Language)` → `Pass 2: Ownership-Language Audit`. Prompt body "ADVERSARIAL REVIEW" → "OWNERSHIP-LANGUAGE AUDIT" and "hostile outsider" → "forensic auditor". NEW in-prompt paragraph: *"This is NOT a security review. Do NOT flag path-traversal, input sanitization, manifest tampering, Unicode bypass, or any other attack-surface / threat-model concern. Software-vulnerability discovery is out of scope."*
  - NEW §13 anti-pattern row: "Treating Pass 2 as a security/threat-model review (path traversal, manifest tampering, Unicode bypass, attack surface) → Pass 2's job is the binary `EXECUTOR: AI` vs `EXECUTOR: HUMAN` audit and the no-`Manual E2E` sweep. Software-vulnerability discovery is a SEPARATE concern, out of scope for this gate."
  - §15 cross-refs line: `Pass 2 (Adversarial; "user is never a tester")` → `Pass 2 (Ownership-Language Audit; "user is never a tester")`.
  - §15 Lupin filename references: preserved verbatim (`05-adversarial-review-prompt.md`) with descriptive callout explaining the PIP rename.
- **Slash-command hard-break**: `--from=adversarial` → `--from=ownership` across 3 surfaces (`workflow/plan-review.md`, `.claude/commands/plan-review.md`, `workflow/INSTALLATION-GUIDE.md`, `workflow/installation-wizard.md`). No backward-compat alias.
- **Historical content preserved verbatim**: `history.md` past entries, `src/rnd/2026.04.27-promote-plan-review-pattern-to-pip.md`, `src/rnd/2026.05.15-rachel-recent-work-summary.md`, and the Lupin `<lupin>/src/rnd/v0.1.7/2026.04.23-cj-flow-async-multi-lane/05-adversarial-review-prompt.md` file. The Lupin file's `[DONE, DO NOT REEXECUTE]` header makes preservation safe; PIP-side header pointer to be added by Maria / next Lupin session (filed as TODO).
- **Mid-execution scope correction**: original scope grep missed `workflow/installation-wizard.md` (5 occurrences across description strings, catalog text, install-flow note). Caught during Phase 5 verification re-grep; patched and re-verified clean before declaring Phase 5 complete. Documented in this entry so future scope checks include the installation-wizard surface.
- **7 verification greps clean**:
  - A. Stale "Pass 2 Adversarial" patterns in live docs → **0 hits**.
  - B. New "Ownership-Language Audit" / "Ownership Audit" in `plan-review.md` → 15 hits.
  - C. "NOT A SECURITY REVIEW" banner present → 2 hits (banner + anti-pattern callout).
  - D. Security/threat-model anti-pattern row present → 1 hit.
  - E. "forensic auditor" stance descriptor in prompt body → 1 hit.
  - F. New `--from=ownership` flag across 3 surfaces → present in each.
  - G. Historical "adversarial" preserved in `history.md` past entries → 7 hits (correct — these are intentional historical records).
- **Cross-link to today's other Rachel artifact**: `src/rnd/2026.05.15-rachel-recent-work-summary.md` (morning broadcast deliverable summarizing Sessions 81-88). That doc deliberately retains "Pass 2 Adversarial" wording in its Session-83 section because it's historical narration of Session 83's work-as-of-that-date.

**Plan**: `src/rnd/2026.05.15-plan-review-rename-drop-adversarial.md` — status now 🟢 IMPLEMENTED.

**Out of Scope (deferred)**: Phase 4 Lupin-side header pointer for `<lupin>/src/rnd/v0.1.7/2026.04.23-cj-flow-async-multi-lane/05-adversarial-review-prompt.md` and `/06-fitness-review-prompt.md` — owner Maria / next Lupin session (filed as new TODO.md entry). Filename preservation (no rename of `05-adversarial-review-prompt.md`) per archival-fidelity rule.

**Key insight**: The drift was reproducible-by-design — three reinforcing causes that all surface in software-English-fluent sessions: (a) the word *adversarial* in software contexts defaults to OWASP attacker-mindset; (b) the §8 prompt's "hostile outsider" metaphor reinforced the attacker reading via imagery; (c) milestone-context priming — sessions reviewing file-IO / serialization / input-handling work pre-activate OWASP categories. No grep across the canonical docs surfaced the drift because the drift lived only in spoken/in-context confabulation. The fix isn't "tighten the doctrine" (the doctrine was already correct); it's "rename so the doctrine is impossible to misread." Pass 2's job is the binary `EXECUTOR: AI vs HUMAN` audit and the no-`Manual E2E` sweep — the new name "Ownership-Language Audit" describes the subject directly and carries auditor weight without an ambiguous adjective. Adding the "NOT A SECURITY REVIEW" banner and the §13 security/threat-model anti-pattern row gives any future session that pattern-matches *adversarial* → *attacker* an immediate redirect at the doctrine surface, not just after-the-fact correction by the user.

### 2026.05.15 - Session 88 | TTS Brevity Self-Violation Recovery + Persona-First Mandate (Rio)

**Persona**: Rio (cosa-voice session `8ebced94`, voice id `AZnzlk1XvdvUeBnXmlld`, icon ⚡) — chorus mode, speakerphone-driven conversation with Mr. Rick.

**Problem framed by Mr. Rick (voice, mid-session)**: Rio's session-opening audit `notify()` (re cosa-voice "phone mode" vs "QUIET mode" surface drift) carried 175 spoken words of inventory: terminology in conflict, file:line callouts, recommended-fix rationale, ownership attribution. The card had the same content as a table but ZERO doc-viewer links. Mr. Rick called the violation verbatim: *"You yourself just violated 1 of the first mandates… All detail is supposed to be pushed into the abstract, along with working doc links."* Compounded with three follow-on voice asks (persona-first, doc-link literacy at startup, `get_session_info()` envelope discovery) and one language-tightening rebuke (*"Strike it… replace with MUST"*), the work crystallized as a 5-hook recovery plan landed in a single session.

**Accomplishments**:

- **Recovery plan serialized v1 → v2** at `src/rnd/2026.05.15-tts-brevity-mandate-self-violation-recovery.md` per documentation-first protocol (BEFORE any code/doctrine edits). v1 captured the 5 hooks with mixed soft/MUST phrasing; v2 stripped all advisory hedging and replaced with MANDATORY language after Mr. Rick's verbatim rebuke "we need to be more dictatorial about it." Final v2 carries 17 MUST/MANDATORY/PROHIBITED/VIOLATION occurrences across 7 sections, with top-of-doc LANGUAGE MANDATE banner closing the linguistic escape vector.
- **Three failure modes diagnosed** (each gets its own hook):
  - **(a) Inventory creep into spoken channel** — the audit `notify()` recited terminology + file paths + rationale (hooks 1, 2, 3).
  - **(b) Persona-blind first response** — Rio observed compliant this session (called `get_session_info()` before first ack, named "Rio" in the spoken opener); but Mr. Rick reported the failure mode happening across other sessions: *"They must know who they are before they respond and if they can't find out who they are, they can ask me, but never assume."* (Hook 4.)
  - **(c) Doc-link illiteracy at startup** — sessions emitting `(/app/docs?...)` URLs in spoken `message` parameters (TTS verbalizes character-by-character) AND missing that `get_session_info()` already returns the `doc_scope` envelope (`{scope, base_url, allowed_prefixes, source}`) as a same-call discovery primitive. (Hook 5, coupled to Hook 4 — one MCP call resolves both.)
- **Five hooks across six surfaces** — all landed in this session:

| Hook | What | Target file | Phase |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Pre-`notify()` MUST-audit gate (new bullet § Brevity Rules) | `workflow/cosa-voice-integration.md` | B |
| 2 | Anchor example #2 (175→22 words, ~87% reduction) — parallels Session 82's #1 (190→45) | same canonical hub | B |
| 3 | Reference-trigger MANDATE: abstract referencing a file MUST link it; doc-links ONLY in `abstract` | `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` (live) + `global/CLAUDE.md` (mirror) | C |
| 4 | Persona-First Response Mandate — strengthened MCP STARTUP PROTOCOL Phase A | `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`, `global/CLAUDE.md`, `workflow/claude-config-global.md`, `workflow/session-start.md` (new § Preliminary 0) | D |
| 5 | Doc-Link Literacy + `doc_scope` envelope discovery — coupled with hook 4 in same Phase A | same four startup surfaces | D |

- **Hub-and-spoke sync precedent honored** — same pattern as Sessions 75/76/77/78/79/81/82/85/86/87: `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` (live, host-global) ↔ `global/CLAUDE.md` (repo mirror) kept byte-identical for the touched sections (verified clean for Phase A + DOCUMENT VIEWER LINKS). Pre-existing divergence at line 390+ (§ SPEAKERPHONE & TTS BEHAVIOR vs § INTERACTIVE TOOL ROUTING) noted as out-of-scope drift from an earlier session.
- **Phase A startup quadruplet patched** with MUST language:
  - Live `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` § MCP SESSION STARTUP PROTOCOL — Phase A expanded to 4 steps, step 3 now spells out (a) persona extraction with "Persona-First Response Mandate (2026-05-15)" sub-rule and (b) `doc_scope` envelope extraction with "Doc-Link Literacy Mandate (2026-05-15)" sub-rule.
  - `global/CLAUDE.md` mirror identical patch.
  - `workflow/claude-config-global.md` template gained new `### Persona-First & Doc-Link Literacy` section after the Conversation Mode block.
  - `workflow/session-start.md` gained **new `## Preliminary 0: Phase A MCP Startup (MANDATORY — before ANY user-facing text)`** section as the FIRST section, before the existing Preliminary start notification. Preliminary 0 codifies the 5-step ritual: ToolSearch → `get_session_info()` → extract persona → extract doc_scope → self-check before proceeding. Anti-patterns memorialized (response-first/identity-after, mid-turn `get_session_info()` "for completeness," URL in `message=`, persona-default-assumption).
- **Mr. Rick voice rebukes captured in status log** — all four verbatim asks preserved at `src/rnd/2026.05.15-...md` § 7 Status log, plus the v2 language-hardening directive: *"We need to be more dictatorial about it and replace it with MUST."*
- **Phase E verification (greps clean)**:
  - A. Hook 1+2 in canonical hub → 2 + 1 hits.
  - B. Hook 3 in live + mirror → 1 + 1 hits.
  - C. Hooks 4+5 across all four startup surfaces → 3 + 3 + 2 + 2 = 10 hits.
  - D. New "Preliminary 0" section in session-start.md → 1 hit.
  - E. Doc-link URLs in any `message=` kwarg across `workflow/` + `global/` + `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` → **0 hits** (zero — clean sweep, validates Hook 5 hasn't been violated in canonical surfaces).
  - F. Live ↔ mirror byte-identical for Phase A and DOCUMENT VIEWER LINKS sections → clean.
- **Memory salience persisted** at `~/.claude/projects/-mnt-DATA01-.../memory/feedback_tts_brevity.md` (host-side, outside repo): added 2026-05-15 hardenings — MUST-audit gate, Doc-Link Literacy, Persona-First Response Mandate — plus cross-reference to this recovery plan. Future sessions will recall the hardened doctrine on session start.
- **Self-correction in-session demonstrated**: Rio re-issued the original audit verdict per Hook 1's audit-gate rule — 175-word spoken inventory replaced with a 22-word verdict ("Home CLAUDE file is clean; the drift lives inside cosa-voice itself, May-14 evening reframe missed one surface"), and the abstract restored with 7 working doc-viewer links per Hook 3's reference-trigger MANDATE. The recovery plan's Anchor Example #2 memorializes this 87%-reduction failure-mode-and-fix pair.

**Files Changed** (in PIP repo):

| File | Change | Lines (est.) |
|---|---|---|
| `src/rnd/2026.05.15-tts-brevity-mandate-self-violation-recovery.md` | NEW (v2 final) | +396 |
| `workflow/cosa-voice-integration.md` | Hook 1 bullet + Hook 2 anchor example sub-section | +23 |
| `global/CLAUDE.md` | Hook 3 (DOCUMENT VIEWER LINKS) + Hooks 4+5 (Phase A) | +14 / -3 |
| `workflow/claude-config-global.md` | new `### Persona-First & Doc-Link Literacy` section | +16 |
| `workflow/session-start.md` | new `## Preliminary 0: Phase A MCP Startup` section | +27 / -2 |
| `history.md` | this entry | +N |
| `TODO.md` | deferred fresh-session dogfood entry | +1 |
| `.claude-session.md` | new Session 88 section | +N |

Plus out-of-repo (NOT committed): `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` (live home global — mirrored from `global/CLAUDE.md`) and `~/.claude/projects/.../memory/feedback_tts_brevity.md` (memory salience).

**Plan**: `src/rnd/2026.05.15-tts-brevity-mandate-self-violation-recovery.md` v2 — status now 🟢 IMPLEMENTED.

**Out of Scope (deferred)**: Fresh-session dogfood verification of Preliminary 0 firing correctly in practice (requires a NEW Claude Code session — Mr. Rick's pending exit-and-restart). Also still deferred from earlier scope: the original Lupin-side cosa-voice surface drift fix (phone mode ≠ QUIET mode terminology in `cosa_voice_mcp.py` MCP startup blob) — owned by Maria / next Lupin session, untouched in this PIP-only commit.

**Key insight**: The 5-hook landing exemplifies a triangle of failure-mode classes that all share a single startup-time root cause:
- **Hook 1+2 (brevity)**: bloat in the spoken channel — root cause is drafting `message` + `abstract` in parallel as exec-summary + detail, rather than as verdict-only + inventory.
- **Hook 4 (persona)**: identity-blind responses — root cause is skipping `get_session_info()` before composing user-facing text.
- **Hook 5 (doc-link)**: URLs in spoken channels + manual scope guessing — root cause is missing that `get_session_info()` already returns the `doc_scope` envelope as a same-call primitive.

Three failure modes, ONE root cause: **the first MCP call MUST be `get_session_info()`, and its return value MUST be fully unpacked (persona + doc_scope) BEFORE composing any user-facing text** — including the first acknowledgment, including in speakerphone mode. The session-start workflow's new "Preliminary 0" section is the codification of this single root-cause fix; everything else (the audit gate, the anchor example, the reference-trigger MANDATE) is downstream protection against the bloat patterns that emerge when the startup ritual is skipped.

### 2026.05.14 - Session 87 | Cross-repo doc viewer scope doctrine (Rachel)

**Persona**: Rachel (cosa-voice session `4926c582`) — speakerphone-driven design conversation with Rick.

**Problem framed by Rick (voice)**: doc viewer links sent via `notify()` use a `scope` query param to identify which registered repo the path belongs to. The global doctrine in `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` only documented two scopes (`docs`, `io` — both Lupin built-ins) and was silent about the 7 external scopes already registered in Lupin's `external repos` INI (`lupin`, `cosa-voice`, `planning-is-prompting`, `lupin-mobile`, `lookml`, `par-pacific`, `claude-plans`). Cross-repo sessions had no formal guidance for choosing the right scope — they guessed.

**Accomplishments**:

- **Multi-pass design conversation with two architecture pivots** (both Rick's calls, accepted):
  - **Pivot 1** — original sketch was a standalone `get_doc_scope()` MCP tool. Rick pattern-matched the existing `voice_persona` field embedded in `get_session_info()` and proposed putting `doc_scope` in the same envelope. Accepted: zero new tool, zero extra round trip, self-discoverable on session-info inspection.
  - **Pivot 2** — original sketch had cosa-voice re-parsing Lupin's INI directly. Rick flagged the ownership smell: the scope registry already lives on the Lupin side (`src/cosa/rest/routers/_scope_registry.py::build_scope_registry()`). Accepted: Lupin owns registry + exposes via API; cosa-voice consumes. Avoids duplicating reserved-name handling, missing-path skip logic, and prefix-trim semantics.
- **R&D doc serialized** at `src/rnd/2026.05.14-doc-link-scope-cross-repo.md` (247 lines, 8 sections + status log) per documentation-first protocol. Covers: problem, current state with full registry table, 3-work-item solution, detailed design (doctrine text, per-repo pin template, `get_session_info()` extension spec), 5 phases, risks/open-questions, cross-references, approval checklist.
- **Phase 2 (doctrine update) landed**:
  - `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` § DOCUMENT VIEWER LINKS — old 2-line scope routing block replaced with full routing rule (~20 lines): built-in vs external scope split, 4-step priority order for choosing the right scope, reference to `doc_scope` field in `get_session_info()` output.
  - `planning-is-prompting/global/CLAUDE.md` — identical mirror update (canonical snapshot).
- **Phase 3 (per-repo `## Doc Viewer Scope` pins) landed in 5 of 7 target repos**:
  - `lupin/CLAUDE.md` — pin recommends built-ins (`docs`/`io`) over external `lupin` scope.
  - `planning-is-prompting/CLAUDE.md` — `scope=planning-is-prompting`, prefixes `src/`, `workflow/`, `docs/`.
  - `lupin-mobile/CLAUDE.md` — `scope=lupin-mobile`, wildcard prefixes.
  - `google/lookml/CLAUDE.md` — `scope=lookml`, `src/`.
  - `google/par-pacific.../CLAUDE.md` — `scope=par-pacific`, `src/`.
  - **Deferred**: `cosa-voice` (repo not on host filesystem at expected mount path), `claude-plans` (flat plan dump at `~/.claude/plans/`, no CLAUDE.md convention) — both noted in R&D §4.2 and status log.
- **Lupin TODO filed** (per Rick's clarification on ownership) at `lupin/TODO.md` under "🔗 NEW — `doc_scope` registry exposure for cosa-voice consumption" with 5 [LUPIN] checkboxes covering: exposure mechanism decision (recommended `GET /api/docs/scopes`), implementation, registry expansion to include built-ins, coordination with cosa-voice, smoke test.
- **Documentation-first cadence honored**: R&D doc serialized BEFORE any code/doctrine edits; design pivots captured in the doc's status log so future readers see the reasoning chain.

**Files Changed (cross-repo)**:

| Repo | File | LoC (ins/del) |
|---|---|---|
| planning-is-prompting | `CLAUDE.md` (pin) | +11 / -0 |
| planning-is-prompting | `global/CLAUDE.md` (doctrine mirror) | +19 / -3 |
| planning-is-prompting | `src/rnd/2026.05.14-doc-link-scope-cross-repo.md` (NEW) | +247 |
| lupin | `CLAUDE.md` (pin) | +12 / -0 |
| lupin | `TODO.md` (consumer-side ownership entry) | +23 / -0 |
| lupin-mobile | `CLAUDE.md` (pin) | +12 / -1 |
| google/lookml | `CLAUDE.md` (pin) | +11 / -0 |
| google/par-pacific... | `CLAUDE.md` (pin) | +11 / -0 |
| ~/.claude (not a repo) | `CLAUDE.md` (live doctrine) | +19 / -3 |

**Session totals**: 9 files across 5 repos + home global, **+365 insertions / -7 deletions** (net +358).

**Commit scope (this session — planning-is-prompting only, per Rick's "@maria only lupin" broadcast)**:
- `planning-is-prompting/CLAUDE.md` + `global/CLAUDE.md` + `src/rnd/2026.05.14-doc-link-scope-cross-repo.md` + `history.md` + (this entry).
- **Out-of-repo edits intentionally left for owning sessions**: lupin (Maria), lupin-mobile (next mobile session), google/* (next session in those repos), `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` (host-global, never committed).

**Plan**: No `~/.claude/plans/` plan file (conversational design, not plan-mode). R&D doc serves as the canonical design record per documentation-first protocol.

**Out of Scope (deferred)**:
- Phase 4 — cosa-voice MCP `get_session_info()` extension. **Gated on Lupin landing the `/api/docs/scopes` exposure** (see Lupin TODO).
- `cosa-voice` and `claude-plans` per-repo pins (host filesystem doesn't have a co-located CLAUDE.md target).
- End-to-end spot-test from each repo (Phase 5) — needs Phase 4 first.

**Key insight**: Both pivots tightened the design by aligning with existing infrastructure rather than building parallel. Pivot 1 reused the `voice_persona` envelope; Pivot 2 reused `_scope_registry.py`. The cleanest cross-repo design here is the one that adds the least new machinery — it embeds in existing data structures and respects existing ownership boundaries.

### 2026.05.14 - Session 86 | Cross-Session Communication Doctrine

#### Checkpoint | 2026.05.14 22:45 | Cross-session doctrine + bug #2 stale `notification-system.md` refs

**Files**: workflow/cross-session-communication.md (NEW), workflow/claude-config-global.md, global/CLAUDE.md, workflow/cosa-voice-integration.md, README.md, src/rnd/2026.05.14-cross-session-communication-doctrine.md (NEW), CLAUDE.md, workflow/p-is-p-00-start-here.md (+ history.md, TODO.md)
**Commit**: eb72575

**Accomplishments**:

- **Closed a doctrine gap** opened when Lupin shipped v0.1.7 Phase 1 (Claude↔Claude commons blackboard with 5 MCP tools — `commons_post`, `commons_read`, `commons_who`, `commons_ask_sync`, `commons_ask_async`) and Phase 2 (user→all-sessions broadcast with persona-aware `@PersonaName:` directives). User confirmed the broadcast feature works end-to-end after first pilot, but the global `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` and every PIP-distributed workflow doc said nothing about either surface. Every Claude session had cross-session wiring with no behavioral doctrine. This session writes that doctrine.
- **Plan-mode brainstorm in conversation, three decisions reached** (verbatim "That seems reasonable" from user × 3):
  - **Q1 — Autonomy thresholds**: three-tier impact-based cut. Tier 1 (Read — `commons_who`, `commons_read`) always allowed. Tier 2 (Self-disclosure write — `commons_post` to `presence`/`incidents`) allowed at session initiative. Tier 3 (Attention-demanding — `commons_ask_*`, contested `coordination` claims) requires explicit user trigger OR clear coordination need (file collision, contested bug claim).
  - **Q2 — Topic discipline**: reserved core (`presence`, `coordination`, `help-wanted`, `incidents`, `broadcasts`, `broadcast-acks`) + organic extension. Reserved topic names ARE the signaling protocol — couples Q1 with Q2 elegantly.
  - **Q3 — Broadcast receipt contract**: original "interrupt vs queue" framing reframed (broadcasts inject as `<system-reminder>` between turns, not mid-tool-execution). Real axes are routing (persona match → ACT; other persona → ACK-ONLY; no persona → all ACT on default body) and voice (speakerphone ON → spoken ack via `notify(suppress_ding=True, priority='high')`; OFF → text-only ack). Mandatory `broadcast-acks` post is infrastructure.
- **Four-layer signaling architecture** also accepted: (1) static doctrine in global CLAUDE.md + new workflow doc, (2) tier markers embedded in MCP tool descriptions (Lupin-side follow-up), (3) reserved topic names as peer-facing tier markers, (4) `notify()` to user when attention-demanding mode entered so cross-session dialogue is never invisible.
- **Hub-and-spoke documentation pattern** (same precedent as Sessions 81/85):
  - **Tier 1 — canonical hub** `workflow/cross-session-communication.md` NEW (1509 words, 7 sections, 1 mermaid routing diagram): Purpose + when-to-use, Two surfaces + quick MCP tool reference, Three-tier autonomy with examples, Reserved topic vocabulary with example bodies, Broadcast receipt rules (routing + voice), Anti-patterns (loop hazards, attention abuse, sensitive content), User-facing visibility mandate, Lupin-side follow-ups.
  - **Tier 2 — global config sync pair**: `global/CLAUDE.md` and `workflow/claude-config-global.md` both gained new `## CROSS-SESSION COMMUNICATION` section (458 words, under the 800-word target) inserted after the cosa-voice notification system section.
  - **Tier 3 — cross-link spoke**: `workflow/cosa-voice-integration.md` gained "Related: cross-session communication tools (`commons_*`)" subsection after the Available MCP Tools table.
  - **Tier 4 — README index**: New `### Cross-Session Communication` subsection in Supporting Workflows + design-notes entry in Plan File Management.
  - **Design notes**: `src/rnd/2026.05.14-cross-session-communication-doctrine.md` NEW (1311 words) — captures survey of Lupin infrastructure, all three Q1/Q2/Q3 decisions with rationale, conversation log, follow-ups.
- **Bug #2 swept** (user said "that's the second bug you can look into after the first topic in hand" when I noted the discrepancy during planning): stale references to `workflow/notification-system.md` (renamed to `workflow/cosa-voice-integration.md` on 2026.01.06 per the file's own version-history) cleaned from live docs. `CLAUDE.md:30` (project directory tree) and `workflow/p-is-p-00-start-here.md:819` (integration list) both updated. Historical references in `history/2025-10-17-to-2026-01-31-history.md`, `src/rnd/2026.01.05-cosa-voice-mcp-migration-plan.md`, and the version-history line in `cosa-voice-integration.md` preserved as intentional migration record.
- **Verification (all greps clean)**:
  - A. Cross-references from new doctrine resolve → 4 hits (README, claude-config-global.md, cosa-voice-integration.md, global/CLAUDE.md).
  - B. New `## CROSS-SESSION COMMUNICATION` section in CLAUDE.md template word count → 458 (under 800-word target).
  - C. Mermaid routing diagram present in doctrine doc → 1.
  - D. Stale `notification-system.md` refs remaining in live docs → 0 (only intentional historical/migration refs left).

**Files Changed**: `workflow/cross-session-communication.md` (NEW canonical doctrine), `workflow/claude-config-global.md` (template +1 section, 458 words), `global/CLAUDE.md` (snapshot mirror +1 section), `workflow/cosa-voice-integration.md` (Related-cross-session-tools subsection added), `README.md` (Cross-Session Communication subsection + design-notes entry in Plan File Management), `src/rnd/2026.05.14-cross-session-communication-doctrine.md` (NEW design notes, promoted scratchpad → 🟢 FINAL), `CLAUDE.md` (bug #2: directory tree corrected + cross-session-communication.md added), `workflow/p-is-p-00-start-here.md` (bug #2: integration list corrected + new Cross-Session Communication entry), `history.md` (this entry), `TODO.md` (Session-86 progress noted on the Cosa-voice MCP commons tools TODO).

**Plan**: `~/.claude/plans/recursive-sparking-floyd.md` (approved via ExitPlanMode 2026-05-14 after three "That seems reasonable" decisions in conversation), serialized to `src/rnd/2026.05.14-cross-session-communication-doctrine.md` per plan-serialization mandate.

**Out of Scope (deferred to TODO follow-on)**: Lupin-side MCP tool description tier markers (`src/lupin_mcp/cosa_voice_mcp.py` registrations), Lupin Phase 3 push-mode for `commons_ask_async` reply injection (already designed at `<lupin>/src/rnd/v0.1.7/2026.05.09-inter-session-commons/04-phase3-push-mode-and-llm-fallback-design.md`), LLM-fallback persona matcher (stubbed in `commons_persona_matcher.py`), optional `cross-session-communication` Agent Skill (deferred — static doctrine in CLAUDE.md is sufficient initially).

**Key insight**: The signaling design's third layer (reserved topic names ARE the tier marker) collapsed Q1 (autonomy thresholds) and Q2 (topic vocabulary) into one coupled answer. Once the topic name encodes the tier, the doctrine almost writes itself: post to `presence` and it's self-disclosure; post to `help-wanted` and you're flagging attention-demanding. No metadata field needed for tier — the topic IS the metadata.

### 2026.05.11 - Session 85 | `ask_yes_no()` Neither Response Language Sync

**Accomplishments**:

- **Closed a documentation-drift gap** opened when cosa-voice MCP `ask_yes_no()` gained a third "Neither" return value (re-frame escape hatch). PIP workflow docs and the live global `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` still described the tool as **binary** with 4 response variants. This session swept the binary wording out across the repo + live global and replaced it with ternary language plus an explicit re-frame protocol.
- **Hub-and-spoke pattern (same precedent as Session 81 TTS Brevity Mandate)**:
  - **Tier 1 — canonical hub** `workflow/cosa-voice-integration.md`: new ~70-line `#### Handling Neither — the Re-Frame Escape Hatch` subsection between `#### Qualified Comments` and `### converse()`. Contains the canonical ternary parser pattern, an anti-pattern table (treat-as-no, treat-as-yes, ignore-qualifier, re-ask-same-question, use-default-neither), "When to expect Neither" guidance, and a **CRITICAL destructive-op rule** ("Neither MUST NOT proceed — re-frame and re-prompt; `default` offers no fallback because Neither requires an explicit user click and cannot arrive via timeout"). Response Format table expanded 4 → 6 rows (yes/no/neither × ±comment). Summary-table row at line 199 (`Binary yes/no decision` → `Ternary yes/no/neither decision`). Intro line at line 294 rewritten. Qualified Comments section updated to mention C-key works on all three values.
  - **Tier 2 — global config sync pair**: live `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` (outside repo) updated in two cells (routing table + destructive-ops table); `global/CLAUDE.md` repo mirror re-synced byte-identical via `diff -q`. Template `workflow/claude-config-global.md` updated in two places (tool-summary row + "Need approval" guidance paragraph). Same sync-pair precedent as Sessions 75/76/77/78/79/81/82.
  - **Tier 3 — callsite spokes** (6 files, 14 callsites updated): `workflow/session-end.md` (2 callsites + 2 parser-hint lines at top), `workflow/session-checkpoint.md` (2 callsites — missing-manifest fallback + docs-only commit), `workflow/branch-pr-and-merge.md` (4 callsites — merge-confirmation, branch-cleanup, release-tagging, integration-tests; **destructive ops tagged CRITICAL inline**), `workflow/bug-fix-mode.md` (4 callsites — context-clear, no-manifest, empty-manifest, session-closure; atomic-commit safety preserved), `workflow/installation-wizard.md` (1 callsite), `workflow/uninstall-wizard.md` (1 callsite, **CRITICAL**).
  - **Tier 4 — mention tweaks** (3 files): `workflow/session-start.md` line 92 description tweak (binary → ternary), `.claude/commands/plan-review.md` (2 mentions — doc-set picker + gate decisions), `.claude/commands/plan-skills-management.md` (deletion-confirmation **CRITICAL**).
- **Verification (all 5 greps clean)**:
  - A. Hub has `Handling Neither` subsection → 4 hits (1 header + 3 cross-refs).
  - B. Hub Response Format table has 6 variants → 6 rows match.
  - C. Stale "Binary yes/no" wording across workflow/ + global/ + CLAUDE.md → **0 hits** (zero — clean sweep).
  - D. All 6 Tier-3 spokes reference Neither → 6/6 OK.
  - E. `diff -q ~/.claude/CLAUDE.md global/CLAUDE.md` → clean (byte-identical).
- **Plan serialized** to `src/rnd/2026.05.11-neither-response-language-sync.md` per plan-serialization mandate before any code/doc edits, per Documentation-First Protocol.

**Files Changed**: `workflow/cosa-voice-integration.md` (hub surgery + Qualified Comments tweak), `global/CLAUDE.md` (2 cells), `workflow/claude-config-global.md` (template, 2 cells), `workflow/session-end.md` (2 callsites + 2 hints), `workflow/session-checkpoint.md` (2 callsites), `workflow/branch-pr-and-merge.md` (4 callsites + CRITICAL inline), `workflow/bug-fix-mode.md` (4 callsites), `workflow/installation-wizard.md` (1 callsite), `workflow/uninstall-wizard.md` (1 callsite + CRITICAL), `workflow/session-start.md` (1 line tweak), `.claude/commands/plan-review.md` (2 mentions), `.claude/commands/plan-skills-management.md` (1 mention + CRITICAL), `src/rnd/2026.05.11-neither-response-language-sync.md` (new plan), `history.md`, `TODO.md`. Plus `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` (live, outside repo, 2 cells).

**Plan**: `src/rnd/2026.05.11-neither-response-language-sync.md` (in-context plan, no `~/.claude/plans/` artifact since plan was drafted in conversation, not via plan mode).

**Out of Scope (deferred to TODO follow-on)**: `~/.claude/skills/cosa-voice-notifications/SKILL.md` (Tier-5, outside repo — needs trigger-rich description update + progressive-disclosure body update with ternary parser + anchor example); `converse()` `response_type="yes_no"` parallel surface (separate decision, separate plan).

**Key insight**: The Neither contract is **structurally identical** to the TTS Brevity Mandate spec from Session 81 — both involve a tool-level capability gain that needs a hub-and-spoke language sweep, both have destructive-op corner cases that justify CRITICAL callouts inline at the callsite (not just in the hub), and both follow the "live global + repo mirror byte-identical" sync pattern. The difference: TTS Brevity touched ~31 files; Neither touched ~14 because the spec is smaller (one tool, one new return value vs. a global mandate that affects every notify() call).

### 2026.05.06 - Session 84 | Day's Work Summary at Session-End (Step 6)

**Accomplishments**:

- **Closed the user-stated gap** that session-end "trails off" without a closing artifact. Added new **Step 6: Day's Work Summary** to `workflow/session-end.md` between Step 5 (Backup Prompt) and Final Verification. Step 6 is now the LAST visible/audible artifact of every session per the user's intent.
- **Reused lupin's existing analyzers, no new code**: the `BranchChangeAnalyzer` and `DirectoryAnalyzer` at `<lupin>/src/cosa/repo/` already produce LoC deltas with code/comment/docstring breakdown per language and emit JSON. Step 6 invokes them via `LUPIN_ROOT` env-var-gated `cd "$LUPIN_ROOT/src" && python -m cosa.repo.run_branch_analyzer ...` — same env-var-gated optional-tool pattern PIP already uses for `PLANNING_IS_PROMPTING_ROOT` in `backup-version-check.md` and `installation-wizard.md`.
- **Graceful three-tier fallback chain** so the summary never blocks session-end:
  1. **Rich path**: cosa Branch Analyzer with code/comment/docstring breakdown per language.
  2. **Native fallback**: `git diff --shortstat $(git merge-base HEAD main)..HEAD` (line totals only) plus an upgrade-path note explaining how to enable the rich path via `LUPIN_ROOT`.
  3. **Skip path**: orphan branches or empty branches emit a one-line "no diff data" note and continue to Final Verification.
- **Real-world venv quirk caught at Tier-2 verification**: system Python lacks `PyYAML`, but the cosa-internal venv at `$LUPIN_ROOT/src/cosa/.venv/bin/python` has it (yaml 6.0.2). Updated §6.2 and §6.5 with a `$PYBIN` discovery shim — prefer cosa venv, fall back to lupin top-level venv, then system `python3`. If even that raises `ModuleNotFoundError`, treat as §6.2 failure and degrade to native git.
- **TTS Brevity Mandate compliance baked in**: spoken `notify(message=...)` is a 1-sentence conversational headline ("Day's wrap: plus one-eighty-nine lines net across seven files, mostly Python") with explicit anti-pattern example showing the verbose format that's prohibited. Full markdown table goes to `abstract`. Headline-not-inventory and tiered-length-cap rules from Sessions 81/82 carry through.
- **Slash-command flags**: `/plan-session-end` now accepts `--summary`/`--no-summary` and `--baseline`/`--no-baseline` (defaults: both ON). Power users get a fast wrap-up path; default behavior matches user's "very last thing" intent.
- **Tier-1 grep verification**: all six greps returned matches (Step 6 header, LUPIN_ROOT references, BranchChangeAnalyzer/run_branch_analyzer references, slash-command flag parsing, INSTALLATION-GUIDE prerequisite section).
- **Tier-2 live invocation against PIP itself**: ran the rich path against this branch (47 files, +4322/-2212 markdown lines since `main`). JSON output validates the documented shape: `overall.{total_added,total_removed,net_change,files_changed}` populated, `by_file_type[]` shows pure-markdown breakdown, `language_details` empty (analyzer only does code/comment/docstring split for python/javascript/typescript). PIP's markdown-heavy nature renders correctly in the table — `Code: 100%, Comment: —, Docstring: —` is the expected and informative result.

**Files Changed**: `workflow/session-end.md` (~250 line addition for Step 6), `.claude/commands/plan-session-end.md` (new rule #4 + flag-set in Usage), `workflow/INSTALLATION-GUIDE.md` (new "Day's Work Summary Prerequisite" subsection + bullet in Session-End feature list), `README.md` (link to plan in Plan File Management section), `src/rnd/2026.05.06-day-of-work-summary-at-session-end.md` (serialized plan, 241 lines), `history.md`, `TODO.md`

**Plan**: `~/.claude/plans/proud-watching-hanrahan.md` (approved via ExitPlanMode 2026-05-06), serialized to `src/rnd/2026.05.06-day-of-work-summary-at-session-end.md` per plan-serialization mandate. Plan file documents the full design including failure modes, design forks, and verification tiers.

**Out of Scope (deferred)**: per-day rollup across multiple branches, persisting day's stats to a `.session-stats.md` log for velocity graphs, history.md auto-injection of the summary table, richer non-cosa fallback (per-language counts via `git diff --numstat` + extension classification). All YAGNI for the immediate ask; documented in the plan's "Out of scope" section.

**Key insight**: The codebase-analysis SKILL.md at `~/.claude/skills/codebase-analysis/SKILL.md` says to run the analyzers with `python -m cosa.repo.run_branch_analyzer` but doesn't document the PyYAML dependency or the cosa venv. The Tier-2 verification surfaced this gap immediately — a manual one-liner that would have failed silently if Step 6 had shipped without live testing. Filed as a TODO follow-up to update the SKILL.md with the venv-selection guidance so other PIP-using projects don't hit the same `yaml` ModuleNotFoundError.

#### Earlier Today | 2026.05.06 14:50 | Plan Review Sequential Execution Mandate (Session 83 wrap)

Session 83 commit `79791b2` already documented above; that work is the predecessor to today's Session 84 feature.

---

### 2026.05.06 - Session 83 | Plan Review Sequential Execution Mandate

**Accomplishments**:

- **Closed a process-loophole** the user observed in the wild: Claude Code ran the three plan-review passes (REUSE pre-pass, Pass 1 Fitness, Pass 2 Adversarial) **in parallel** by spawning concurrent `Agent` subagent calls in a single message, silently bypassing the §6 / §9 user gates (which only function in a serial pipeline). The canonical doc already specified the sequential order in §3 but never explicitly prohibited concurrent execution — the new mandate names the failure mode in language a future agent can't reasonably read past.
- **Four additive hooks, all naming the same failure mode** ("spawn multiple `Agent` (subagent) tool calls in a single message"):
  - `workflow/plan-review.md` line 9 — new top-of-doc **SEQUENTIAL EXECUTION MANDATE (NON-NEGOTIABLE)** banner, sibling to the existing Conversation Mode Awareness callout. Names parallel-`Agent`-spawning, simultaneous sessions, and tool-call batches; references §3 for rationale; ends with "If you find yourself about to issue a single message containing multiple `Agent` invocations covering more than one pass, **STOP** — that is the failure mode this mandate names."
  - `workflow/plan-review.md` §3 line 51 — section title amended to "Fitness Before Adversarial — and Strictly Sequential". New paragraph defines "fully closed" (findings delivered + user gate cleared + Resolution Loop convergence re-grep returns zero new hits) and lists the prohibited dodges. Closing sentence: *"If a competent-but-impatient agent thinks it can save wall-clock time by parallelizing, the answer is no."*
  - `workflow/plan-review.md` §13 line 343 — new Anti-Patterns row covering concurrent `Agent` calls, simultaneous sessions, and batched invocations, with the why ("REUSE may dissolve components Pass 1 was reviewing; Pass 1 may delete steps Pass 2 was wording-polishing") and the user-observed-it-in-practice attribution.
  - `.claude/commands/plan-review.md` line 49 — new rule #6 in the slash-command's "MUST" list mirroring the canonical mandate, with the same PROHIBITED enumeration so the wrapper carries the constraint independently of canonical-doc reads.
- **Why the wording matters**: §6/§9 user gates only function in a serial pipeline. A parallel run produces three findings tables simultaneously, none of which the user has had a chance to gate-clear, and the Resolution Loop's convergence re-grep is meaningless because none of the passes have stable post-fix baselines yet. The new wording makes the gate-bypass argument explicit so future agents can't rationalize parallelism as a wall-clock optimization.
- **Verification**: grep confirms all four hooks present (`SEQUENTIAL EXECUTION MANDATE`, `Strictly sequential`, `Running passes in parallel`, `MUST run the three passes`). Doc structure intact — additive only, no removals, no rule conflicts with the existing Pass Ordering / Anti-Patterns content.

**Files Changed**: `workflow/plan-review.md`, `.claude/commands/plan-review.md`, `history.md`, `TODO.md`

**Plan**: ad-hoc tweak (no plan-mode invocation; user described the exact intent in the opening message — "make sure that this process runs in that order sequentially, and never in parallel").

**Key insight**: The original §3 documented the *order* but treated sequentiality as implicit. In practice, "do A then B then C" doesn't preclude an agent from doing A, B, C in parallel and reading the order as merely a presentation choice. The new wording elevates the constraint from "the recommended order is..." to "concurrent execution is PROHIBITED" — closing the gap between author intent and reader inference. This is the same class of fix as the TTS Brevity Mandate (Session 81/82): an observed real-use failure promoted to an explicit, grep-able mandate.

---

### 2026.05.05 - Session 82 | TTS Brevity Mandate Concision Pass

**Accomplishments**:

- **Refined the Session-81 TTS Brevity Mandate** after user feedback that a 190-word real-use spoken close-out was still too verbose. User confirmed they are "profoundly happy with the level of detail provided in the abstract" — voice should carry verdicts, abstract carries drill-down detail.
- **Three new principles baked into both canonical and headline surfaces**:
  - **Tiered length cap**: routine status close-outs ≈ 60 words / ~20s; substantive turns (architectural decisions, multi-fork outcomes, requested deep readouts) ≈ 80–120 words / ~30s. Old flat 80–120 cap is now the substantive ceiling, not the routine floor.
  - **Headline, don't enumerate**: numbers, file lists, percentages, test counts, paths live in `abstract`, never in the spoken line. Speak the verdict ("tests are green," "two commits ready"); abstract carries the inventory.
  - **No justification for non-actions in spoken line**: skip confidence statements ("structurally identical to X"), process meta ("documented in the log per the mandate"), and rationale for deferred work. The decision is the news; rationale belongs in `abstract` or terminal scrollback.
- **Files touched**:
  - `workflow/cosa-voice-integration.md` (+2,788 chars): replaced Length-discipline bullet with tiered version; inserted two new bullets between Length and Two-channel asymmetry; appended **Anchor example** memorializing the 190-word real-use case → 45-word tightening (76% reduction; zero loss because the abstract still carries full detail).
  - `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` (+522 chars, live, outside repo): modified item 4 → tiered cap; new item 5 (consolidated "Speak the verdict, not the inventory or rationale" covering both content rules); renumbered items 5/6 → 6/7. Live now at 42,519 chars (still over the 40k warning by ~2.5k; TODO has trim candidates).
  - `global/CLAUDE.md`: re-synced from live (`cp` + `diff -q` clean), same precedent as Sessions 75/76/77/78/79/81.
  - `~/.claude/projects/.../memory/feedback_tts_brevity.md` (outside repo): all three refinements added to bullet list with `2026-05-05 refinement` tags + Session 82 origin note in **Why**.
- **Verification**: live ↔ global byte-identical post-sync; canonical doc has new bullets and anchor example present; git status clean of parallel-session interference (only my two repo files modified).

#### Checkpoint | 2026.05.05 23:07 | TTS Brevity Mandate concision pass

**Files**: `workflow/cosa-voice-integration.md`, `global/CLAUDE.md`, `history.md`, `TODO.md`
**Commit**: c48ba70

**Plan**: ad-hoc refinement (no plan-mode invocation; user explicitly approved the three-principle proposal before edits began).

### 2026.05.04 - Session 81 | Conversation-Mode Reinforcement + TTS Brevity Mandate

**Accomplishments** (continuation of Session 80 same date):

- **Surfaced new global behavioral mandate**: after ~1 week of real conversation-mode use, user observed that spoken `notify(message=...)` responses were "verbose markdown dumps that feel like documentation read aloud." Promoted observation to a **TTS Response Brevity Mandate**: spoken payload is *conversational prose, re-crafted for the voice channel*, NOT a verbatim copy of the terminal reply. Strip markdown structure, paths, JSON, URLs, table syntax, section labels; cap at ~30s of speech (~80–120 words) for routine work; use `abstract` parameter aggressively for rich terminal-side content. The terminal reply stays markdown-rich; the spoken version is a précis.
- **Hub-and-spoke documentation pattern** (25 files in scope, 31 actually touched after gap fixes):
  - **Tier 1A (canonical hub, live + mirror)**: added new `### CONVERSATION MODE & TTS RESPONSE BREVITY MANDATE` subsection to `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` inside `## CLAUDE CODE NOTIFICATION SYSTEM` (loaded into every Claude Code session globally). Re-synced repo `global/CLAUDE.md` from live (byte-identical, diff-verified). Same precedented sync pattern as Sessions 75/76/77/78/79.
  - **Tier 1B (canonical hub, repo)**: added new `## Conversation Mode` top-level section (~700 words) to `workflow/cosa-voice-integration.md` between "CRITICAL: User Is NOT Watching the Terminal" and "MANDATORY Notification Requirements". Sub-sections: The Two Modes (with comparison table), Voice Persona, State Checking, Two-Turn Obligations, USER-ONLY INITIATION (HARD RULE), TTS Response Brevity Mandate (full spec, ~250 words), Priority="high" Mandate Intensified, Batch Over Sequential, Cross-Reference. Added Overview-level callout (3 lines) near top of doc pointing readers to the new section.
  - **Tier 2 (session-lifecycle spokes)**: added "⚠️ Conversation Mode Awareness" callouts (~120 words each) to `workflow/session-start.md` (after Phase A check), `workflow/session-end.md` (before "Use Notification System Throughout"), `workflow/session-checkpoint.md` (top, before parallel-session safety). Each reinforces brevity at the specific call sites that matter (session-start summary spoken as 1-sentence orientation, session-end commit-message preview as 1-line subject only, etc.).
  - **Tier 3 (multi-gate procedural spokes)**: added Conversation Mode callouts to `workflow/plan-review.md` (gates §6/§9/§11 — never read findings table aloud row-by-row), `workflow/bug-fix-mode.md` (bug-selection `converse()`, voice persona disambiguation note), `workflow/installation-wizard.md` (catalog selection — speak categories not full catalog), `workflow/branch-pr-and-merge.md` (push/merge gates — destructive ops require explicit voice confirmation).
  - **Tier 4 (lighter-touch workflows, 7 files)**: added 1-paragraph callouts to `history-management.md`, `skills-management.md`, `todo-management.md`, `uninstall-wizard.md`, `testing-baseline.md`, `testing-remediation.md`, `testing-harness-update.md`. Each cross-references the hub and reinforces brevity at the relevant call sites.
  - **Tier 5 (slash-command wrappers, 11 files)**: added compact "⚠️ Note" callouts to all relevant wrappers — `plan-session-{start,end,checkpoint}.md`, `plan-bug-fix-mode{,-start,-continue,-wrap,-close}.md`, `plan-review.md`, `plan-install-wizard.md`, `plan-branch-pr-and-merge.md`, `plan-skills-management.md`, `plan-todo.md`. Each cross-references the hub.
  - **Gap fix (post-verification)**: added callouts to 3 additional files initially missed (`plan-skills-management.md`, `plan-todo.md`, `INSTALLATION-GUIDE.md`) and to `claude-config-global.md` (the template that ships to new projects via the install wizard).
- **Memory persistence**: saved feedback memory to `~/.claude/projects/-mnt-DATA01-.../memory/feedback_tts_brevity.md` so the brevity mandate carries across context clears and into future sessions.
- **Verification**: All four automated greps from the plan §Verification passed — hub presence (5 key terms found in cosa-voice-integration.md), spoke ref check (every workflow/slash-command file using cosa-voice tools references the hub), brevity mention check (every spoke mentions the brevity mandate), global drift check (`~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` and `global/CLAUDE.md` byte-identical).

**Files Changed** (31 total): `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` (live, outside repo), `global/CLAUDE.md`, `workflow/cosa-voice-integration.md`, `workflow/claude-config-global.md`, `workflow/INSTALLATION-GUIDE.md`, `workflow/session-start.md`, `workflow/session-end.md`, `workflow/session-checkpoint.md`, `workflow/plan-review.md`, `workflow/bug-fix-mode.md`, `workflow/installation-wizard.md`, `workflow/branch-pr-and-merge.md`, `workflow/history-management.md`, `workflow/skills-management.md`, `workflow/todo-management.md`, `workflow/uninstall-wizard.md`, `workflow/testing-baseline.md`, `workflow/testing-remediation.md`, `workflow/testing-harness-update.md`, `.claude/commands/plan-session-start.md`, `.claude/commands/plan-session-end.md`, `.claude/commands/plan-session-checkpoint.md`, `.claude/commands/plan-bug-fix-mode.md`, `.claude/commands/plan-bug-fix-mode-start.md`, `.claude/commands/plan-bug-fix-mode-continue.md`, `.claude/commands/plan-bug-fix-mode-wrap.md`, `.claude/commands/plan-bug-fix-mode-close.md`, `.claude/commands/plan-review.md`, `.claude/commands/plan-install-wizard.md`, `.claude/commands/plan-branch-pr-and-merge.md`, `.claude/commands/plan-skills-management.md`, `.claude/commands/plan-todo.md`. Plus memory file `~/.claude/projects/.../memory/feedback_tts_brevity.md` (new, outside repo).

**Plan**: `~/.claude/plans/hey-i-have-a-sharded-alpaca.md` (approved via ExitPlanMode 2026-05-04)

**Out of Scope (flagged for follow-up)**: cosa-voice MCP server change to surface voice-persona in `get_session_info()` response (currently only on `/api/cosa-voice/voice-persona/{session_id}` endpoint). Without this, workflows can't programmatically self-identify as Rachel/etc.; user must tell the AI its persona name. Recommend filing as cosa-voice MCP enhancement.

**Key insight**: The brevity mandate emerged from real-use observation, not theoretical reasoning. After ~1 week of conversation-mode use, the user noticed the failure mode (verbatim markdown read aloud feels like documentation). Promoting the observation to a *global* mandate (in `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` so it loads into every session) catches the regression before it propagates further. The hub-and-spoke pattern keeps PIP DRY: one canonical spec in `workflow/cosa-voice-integration.md`, lightweight cross-references everywhere else.

#### Refinement (commit `15a24d1`) — Two-Channel Asymmetry

User reviewed the initial mandate text and surfaced a clarification: the brevity rules apply to the SPOKEN `notify(message=...)` parameter ONLY — the `abstract` parameter (which renders into the UI/notification card and terminal scrollback) SHOULD remain richly formatted with full markdown, code blocks, headings, tables, file paths, line numbers, JSON snippets. The two channels are **complementary, not duplicates**: voice carries conversational gist, abstract carries the rich written record. The same `notify()` call delivers both — keep `message` short and stripped, keep `abstract` long and formatted.

Rule #6 of the headline mandate was rewritten to make this asymmetry explicit so future sessions don't strip markdown from `abstract` too. Updated in 4 places: `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` (live), `global/CLAUDE.md` (re-synced byte-identical), `workflow/cosa-voice-integration.md` §Conversation Mode → "TTS Response Brevity Mandate", and `~/.claude/projects/.../memory/feedback_tts_brevity.md` (cross-session memory).

**Files Changed (refinement)**: `global/CLAUDE.md`, `workflow/cosa-voice-integration.md` (2 files in repo + 2 outside).

**Why it matters**: without the explicit asymmetry, the natural reading of "strip markdown for TTS" risks bleeding into `abstract` too — defeating the whole point of having a rich written record alongside the spoken précis. This is exactly the kind of clarification that's easy to lose if not codified in the canonical spec.

#### Follow-up sync — Document Viewer Links

User added a new `### DOCUMENT VIEWER LINKS` subsection to `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` after the initial session-end ritual completed: a mandate that when the user asks to view a project file, Claude responds with `notify()` carrying a markdown link to `/app/docs?path=...&scope=docs|io` instead of dumping file contents into chat. Includes scope routing rules (`scope=io` for agent artifacts under `io/`, `scope=docs` for whitelisted root `*.md` + `src/docs/`/`src/rnd/`/`src/workflow/` prefixes) and an out-of-scope rule (ask user to serialize to `src/rnd/` per plan-serialization mandate). Pulled into `global/CLAUDE.md` mirror; byte-identical via diff.

**Files Changed (follow-up sync)**: `global/CLAUDE.md` (1 file in repo).

### 2026.05.04 - Session 80 | Plan-Review Fitness-First Restructure + Install-Wizard Wiring

**Accomplishments**:
- **Pass-ordering restructure** (canonical): rewrote `workflow/plan-review.md` to swap pass order from Adversarial→Fitness (Lupin originating order) to Fitness→Adversarial. Added new `§3 Pass Ordering: Fitness Before Adversarial` documenting rationale ("structural gaps invalidate ownership analysis — wording polish on text fitness-resolution is about to delete or restructure is wasted work"). Counter-argument considered + mitigation noted (ownership errors that pass a Fitness completeness check get caught by the subsequent Adversarial pass; the reverse failure has no mitigation in the alternative ordering). Origin-artifact note preserved that Lupin's order was Adversarial→Fitness.
- **Section renumbering**: REUSE pre-pass moved to §4; new Pass 1 (Fitness) at §5; Gate 1 at §6; Resolution Loop generalized at §7 (now applies to both passes, with explicit per-pass grep enumeration); Pass 2 (Adversarial) at §8; Gate 2 at §9; Termination Rule §10; Layer-3 Design Concerns §11; Idempotency & Re-Invocation §12 with new flag set `--from=reuse|fitness|adversarial`; Anti-Patterns §13 (added "Running adversarial before fitness" entry); Cross-References §14.
- **Wrapper sync**: `.claude/commands/plan-review.md` flag-set semantics swapped (`--from=fitness` now means "skip REUSE; start at Pass 1 Fitness"; `--from=adversarial` now means "skip REUSE+Pass 1; start at Pass 2"). Section cross-references updated (§6 Gate 1, §7 Resolution Loop, §9 Gate 2, §10 Termination, §12 Re-Invocation, §4 REUSE). Usage examples corrected.
- **Downstream sync**: Mermaid flowchart in `workflow/p-is-p-00-start-here.md` (Pass 1: Fitness, Pass 2: Adversarial). Prose adjusted ("design-completeness gaps and ownership-language drift" — order matches new flow). Conventions section in `workflow/p-is-p-02-documenting-the-implementation.md` had 13 Pass references swapped (working-contract enforcement → Pass 2 Adversarial; decision-anchor traceability → Pass 1 Fitness; EXECUTOR tag enforcement → Pass 2; TBD/Open-sub-question demands → Pass 1; Manual-label flagging → Pass 2; skip-with-reason exemption → "the affected pass"). README [C.5] entry order swapped.
- **Install-wizard wiring**: TODO item from Session 79 closed. Added `plan-review-gate` JSON catalog entry under "Review Workflows (Optional)" category (sibling to Planning Workflows). Step 2 menu adds new "REVIEW WORKFLOWS" visual section with `[N] Plan Review Gate` (chose append-as-N to avoid letter cascade through 9 existing entries; tradeoff: visual section ordering breaks letter-alphabetic flow but Plan Review Gate sits cleanly at end of catalog). Step 3 dependency validation block added (depends on `[D]` Planning is Prompting Core). Step 5 install instructions added with customization notes. Bulk-select strings updated to include N.
- **INSTALLATION-GUIDE addition**: New "Plan Review Gate Workflow" section between Testing Workflows and Plan Serialization. Includes What-It-Does, Pass-Ordering rationale, Modes table, Install-as-Slash-Command block, Expected Questions, Usage examples, Key Features, Prerequisites (5 conventions enumerated), Integration with Planning is Prompting Workflows.
- **Catalog/flag-set fidelity verified**: `--from=reuse|fitness|adversarial` consistent across canonical doc (§12), wrapper (lines 27-29), wizard catalog (line 210 description), and INSTALLATION-GUIDE.md (lines 2042-2046). Sub-command `/plan-review-reuse` documented in all four.

**Files Changed**: `workflow/plan-review.md` (full rewrite), `workflow/p-is-p-00-start-here.md` (mermaid + prose), `workflow/p-is-p-02-documenting-the-implementation.md` (13 Pass references), `workflow/installation-wizard.md` (catalog entry + menu + Step 3 + Step 5 + bulk-select), `workflow/INSTALLATION-GUIDE.md` (new section), `.claude/commands/plan-review.md` (flag set + cross-refs + usage), `README.md` ([C.5] entry), `TODO.md`, `history.md`

**Key insight**: User's "fitness before adversarial" intuition surfaced a real ordering tradeoff that the Session 79 lift inherited from Lupin without examining. Documenting the rationale in §3 (with explicit counter-argument + mitigation) means the question is settled in writing — future re-litigation of the choice has a starting point. The Lupin originating prompts (`05-adversarial-review-prompt.md` and `06-fitness-review-prompt.md`) are now §-numbered the opposite way from the canonical's Pass 1/Pass 2 — Origin Artifacts §13 calls this out so the historical artifacts don't read as canonical.

**TODO follow-ups added**: Plan-review dogfood test should now also validate the new ordering. Plan-review fidelity readthrough should confirm the swap doesn't drop signal that Lupin's order carried. Lupin source-artifact header pointers should call out the order difference.

---

## April 2026

### 2026.04.27 - Session 79 | Plan-Review Gate Lift from Lupin

**Accomplishments**:
- Promoted the two-pass adversarial+fitness review pattern from Lupin v0.1.7 CJ Flow R&D into PIP as a canonical workflow + slash-command wrapper. Reads as the doc-quality bar that fills the gap between `DOCUMENTATION-FIRST PROTOCOL` and code (docs-before-code is mandated, but doc-quality wasn't until now).
- **Delta 1 (canonical)**: Created `workflow/plan-review.md` (366 lines, 9 parametrization slots, 5 verbatim "DO NOT fix yet" gate preservations). Sections: 3-layer anchor hierarchy, REUSE pre-pass (runs before Pass 1, not between), Pass 1 (Adversarial), Gate 1, Resolution Loop with baseline-grep convergence, Pass 2 (Fitness), Gate 2, termination rule (quality OR 2-rounds), L3 design-concerns close-loop, idempotency markers, anti-patterns, 9-slot parametrization reference table.
- **Delta 2 (linchpin)**: Amended `workflow/p-is-p-02-documenting-the-implementation.md` with new `## Doc Conventions for Plan-Review Compatibility` section (+137 lines). Establishes 5 conventions with worked examples: working-contract docs (optional), decision-anchor format (numbered + `FROZEN` dated), `EXECUTOR: AI/HUMAN <reason>` tagging, `TBD` / `Open sub-question N:` markers, "Manual E2E" semantics ("not-yet-automated", NEVER "human does it"). Without these, Pass 1's greps return clean and produce false confidence.
- **Delta 3 (flowchart)**: Updated `workflow/p-is-p-00-start-here.md` mermaid flowchart to show `/plan-review` gate between Step 2 (Documenting) and Code. Decision-matrix table at lines 313-322 left untouched (it classifies by TYPE; the gate is a flow concern).
- **Delta 4 (README)**: Added `[C.5] Plan Review Gate` entry to "What gets installed" enumeration.
- **Delta 5 (wrapper)**: Created `.claude/commands/plan-review.md` slash-command wrapper supporting `--from=reuse|adversarial|fitness` for partial reruns plus `/plan-review-reuse` sub-command for Pattern 3 plans (single-doc plans get standalone REUSE pre-pass; full two-pass review out of scope on shape grounds).
- **Plan serialization**: `src/rnd/2026.04.27-promote-plan-review-pattern-to-pip.md` (linked from README §"Plan File Management").
- **History archival**: 26,386 tokens → 7,057 tokens (73% reduction). New archive `history/2025-10-17-to-2026-01-31-history.md` (Sessions 19–56, ~19,905t) covering the cosa-voice MCP migration, bug-fix-mode maturation, multi-session manifest v2.0, and testing-infrastructure expansion period. Adjacent to existing Sessions-1–18 archive.
- **Verification**: All 4 automated grep checks from plan §Verification passed — convention-coverage (22 hits), cross-reference integrity (every file references the canonical), slot inventory (9 unique slots), "DO NOT fix" verbatim preservation (5 hits incl. 3 from source prompts).

**Files Changed**: `workflow/plan-review.md` (new), `workflow/p-is-p-02-documenting-the-implementation.md` (+137), `workflow/p-is-p-00-start-here.md`, `README.md`, `.claude/commands/plan-review.md` (new), `src/rnd/2026.04.27-promote-plan-review-pattern-to-pip.md` (new), `history.md`, `history/2025-10-17-to-2026-01-31-history.md` (new)
**Plan**: `src/rnd/2026.04.27-promote-plan-review-pattern-to-pip.md`
**Originating proposal**: `<lupin>/src/rnd/v0.1.7/2026.04.27-promote-plan-review-pattern-to-pip.md`

**Key insight**: The Phase 1 deliverable is bigger than the originating proposal pre-priced — Phase 2's `p-is-p-02` amendment isn't just "add a tags section," it's "teach the doc shape that produces working-contracts and decision-anchors of the kind `00-`/`01-` exemplify." Stress-test surfaced 3 structural refinements to the originating plan: REUSE pre-pass moved BEFORE Pass 1 (not between), bundled `/plan-review` with `--from=` partial-rerun flag (vs separate adversarial/fitness commands), and termination-rule belt-and-suspenders ("0 new structural findings OR 2 rounds, whichever first") instead of count-only.

### 2026.04.23 - Session 78 | Test Ownership Mandate

**Accomplishments**:
- Embedded a new **TEST OWNERSHIP MANDATE** asserting role separation (human = designer/user; Claude = tester across the full pyramid) at 8 sites: `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`, `global/CLAUDE.md` (byte-identical mirror), `workflow/claude-config-global.md` (portable template), preambles in `workflow/testing-baseline.md` / `testing-remediation.md` / `testing-harness-update.md`, rewritten Step 7 + new `## Autonomous Bug Capture` section in `workflow/bug-fix-mode.md`, reframed scope options in `workflow/testing-remediation.md`, cross-reference in `~/.claude/skills/testing-development/SKILL.md`
- Removed the anti-sentiment language (`bug-fix-mode.md`'s "User prompted for additional tests" and `testing-remediation.md`'s "Present issues for user selection" in both doc and internal-logic spots)
- Serialized plan to `src/rnd/2026.04.23-test-ownership-mandate.md` and linked from README.md
- MANDATE uses the established CLAUDE.md house style (MANDATE + Operating-assumption + Role-separation table + PROHIBITED-phrases list + Required-behavior + Why + How-to-apply); preserves the user's scarcity-argument phrasing verbatim ("not enough time in the world")

**Files Changed**: `global/CLAUDE.md`, `workflow/claude-config-global.md`, `workflow/testing-baseline.md`, `workflow/testing-remediation.md`, `workflow/testing-harness-update.md`, `workflow/bug-fix-mode.md`, `README.md`, `TODO.md`, `src/rnd/2026.04.23-test-ownership-mandate.md` (new)
**Also changed (outside repo)**: `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`, `~/.claude/skills/testing-development/SKILL.md`
**Plan**: `src/rnd/2026.04.23-test-ownership-mandate.md`

**Known follow-up**: `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` grew to 42,419 chars (back over the 40k performance-warning threshold reclaimed in Session 71). TODO.md has a new item to extract one existing large section (INTERACTIVE REQUIREMENTS ELICITATION ~5.7k is the best candidate) to reclaim budget.

#### Checkpoint 1 | 2026.04.23 20:02 | TEST OWNERSHIP MANDATE embedded across global config, portable template, and testing/bug-fix workflows

**Files**: global/CLAUDE.md, workflow/claude-config-global.md, workflow/testing-baseline.md, workflow/testing-remediation.md, workflow/testing-harness-update.md, workflow/bug-fix-mode.md, README.md, TODO.md, src/rnd/2026.04.23-test-ownership-mandate.md (new)

#### Checkpoint 2 | 2026.04.23 20:18 | CLAUDE.md size reclamation via skill extraction

**Summary**: Extracted the INTERACTIVE REQUIREMENTS ELICITATION section (~145 lines, ~4.7k chars) from `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` into a new skill at `~/.claude/skills/interactive-requirements-elicitation/SKILL.md`. Replaced inline section with a compact 18-line stub (purpose + trigger cues + key-behaviors summary + skill pointer). Mirrored to `global/CLAUDE.md` (byte-identical, diff-verified). Reclaims the post-MANDATE size regression: live CLAUDE.md now 38,297 chars vs 42,419 pre-extraction (-4,122), back under the 40k performance-warning threshold with ~1.7k headroom.

**Files**: global/CLAUDE.md, TODO.md (repo-side); `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`, `~/.claude/skills/interactive-requirements-elicitation/SKILL.md` (new, outside repo)

**Session Summary**:
- 2 checkpoints: 365b144 (TEST OWNERSHIP MANDATE) + bfb9e55 (size reclamation)
- 12 files touched across the session (10 in Checkpoint 1 + 3 in Checkpoint 2, one overlap)
- New artifacts: `src/rnd/2026.04.23-test-ownership-mandate.md`, `~/.claude/skills/interactive-requirements-elicitation/SKILL.md`
- Net CLAUDE.md size: 40,826 → 38,297 chars (-2,529 net, despite adding the MANDATE)
- Key insight: the MANDATE + skill extraction is pareto-improvement — we added a high-leverage behavioral rule AND reduced the file. Pattern worth repeating for future additions that threaten to push CLAUDE.md over threshold.

### 2026.04.16 - Session 77 | Global CLAUDE.md Reconciliation (Documentation-First Simplification)

**Accomplishments**:
- Reconciled `global/CLAUDE.md` with live `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` (drift was 14 lines, all inside `### DOCUMENTATION-FIRST PROTOCOL` subsection)
- Removed the second `ask_yes_no()` gate between documentation and code — plan approval is now sufficient authorization to proceed from docs → code
- Removed the `FILE EXTENSION RULE` sub-section (`.md` allowed, other extensions prohibited until confirm)
- Removed the "skip docs and start coding" escape-hatch bullet
- Tightened prohibition table "Why" column to match simplified semantics
- Verified files byte-identical via `diff` after edits (both at 973 lines)

**Files Changed**: `global/CLAUDE.md`
**Plan**: `~/.claude/plans/start-a-new-bug-greedy-rocket.md`

---

### 2026.04.05 - Session 76 | Global CLAUDE.md Reconciliation (Phase B Session Topic)

- Sync 1: Added "cosa-voice tools NOT in deferred tools list" remediation block (12 lines) to MCP SESSION STARTUP PROTOCOL — surfaces the `install-cosa-voice.sh` fix when MCP server is missing from user-scope
- Sync 2: Tightened Phase B Session Topic rules — reworded Phase B Step 4, added **Trigger** and **Self-check** subsections, rewrote Rules bullet to make `set_session_topic()` deferral by default a session-start bug
- Verified files byte-identical via `diff` after each sync

**Files Changed**: `global/CLAUDE.md`
**Plan**: `~/.claude/plans/mossy-cooking-cake.md`

- Mirrored identical change to `global/CLAUDE.md` (repo template stays in sync)
- Added `## Interactive Tool Routing` section to `~/.claude/skills/cosa-voice-notifications/SKILL.md` with before/after examples for all 4 routing scenarios (~100 lines)
- Routing mandate ensures cosa-voice MCP tools are always preferred over `AskUserQuestion` (which has no audio alert), with fallback to `AskUserQuestion` if MCP server unavailable

**Files Changed**: `global/CLAUDE.md`, `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`, `~/.claude/skills/cosa-voice-notifications/SKILL.md`
**Plan**: `src/rnd/2026.03.02-askuserquestion-cosa-voice-routing-mandate.md`

### 2026.02.04 - Session 60 | Bug Fix Mode

### Fixes

**Fix 1-5**: Branch PR and Merge Workflow Gaps + Notification Safety

- **Bug 1**: Branch PR and Merge workflow missing from installation wizard catalog
  - Added JSON metadata block with `branch-pr-and-merge` workflow to `installation-wizard.md`
  - Added menu entry `[H] Branch PR and Merge` with dependency validation (git, gh required)
  - Re-lettered subsequent entries (I, J, K)

- **Bug 2**: Branch deletion `default="yes"` is unsafe (destructive action)
  - Changed to `default="no"` in `branch-pr-and-merge.md` Step 8

- **Bug 3**: Blocking tools missing `priority="high"` mandate
  - Updated global `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` - added CRITICAL mandate and updated all examples
  - Updated `workflow/cosa-voice-integration.md` - added mandate and updated examples
  - Updated `workflow/branch-pr-and-merge.md` - all `ask_yes_no` and `ask_multiple_choice` calls now include `priority="high"`
  - **Discovery**: `ask_yes_no()` MCP tool doesn't accept `priority` parameter (only `converse()` and `ask_multiple_choice()` do)

- **Bug 4**: Release tag creation `default="yes"` is unsafe
  - Changed to `default="no"` in `branch-pr-and-merge.md` Step 9

- **Bug 5**: New branch name prompt timeout too short
  - Doubled from default 300s to 600s (10 min) in `branch-pr-and-merge.md` Step 10

- **Files**: workflow/installation-wizard.md, workflow/branch-pr-and-merge.md, workflow/cosa-voice-integration.md, ~/.claude/CLAUDE.md

### 2026.02.03 - Session 58 | Bug Fix Mode

### Fix 1: Implement Mid-Session Checkpoint Workflow (`/plan-session-checkpoint`)

**Feature**: New workflow for committing work mid-session without triggering full session-end

**Problem**: Users couldn't commit work mid-session without triggering the full session-end workflow. Claude Code's aggressive context clearing makes it important to checkpoint work frequently, but the only options were:
- `/plan-session-end` - Full session wrap with cleanup, archival prompts (ends session)
- `/plan-bug-fix-mode-wrap` - Only available within bug-fix-mode context

**Solution**: Created `/plan-session-checkpoint` workflow that:
- Commits intermediate work without ending the session
- Follows the bug-fix-mode wrap pattern (selective staging, conflict detection)
- Keeps session manifest `active` for continued tracking
- Supports multiple checkpoints within a single session
- Tracks checkpoints in manifest with `**Checkpoints**: N` counter and dedicated sections

**Files Created**:
- `workflow/session-checkpoint.md` - Canonical workflow (~400 lines)
  - 8-step checkpoint process (validate, description, TODO, history, conflicts, commit, manifest, notify)
  - v2.0 parallel session safety (conflict detection)
  - Manifest checkpoint tracking format
  - Auto-generate or custom description option
- `.claude/commands/plan-session-checkpoint.md` - Slash command wrapper

**Files Modified**:
- `CLAUDE.md` - Added session-checkpoint to workflow and commands listings
- `README.md` - Added to Session Management section
- `workflow/INSTALLATION-GUIDE.md` - Added Session-Checkpoint Workflow section
- `workflow/session-start.md` - Added checkpoint tracking format to manifest documentation

### 2026.02.02 - Session 57 | Bug Fix Mode

### Fix 1: Implement Parallel-Session-Friendly Bug Fix Queue (v2.0)

**Feature**: Redesigned bug-fix-queue.md format to support multiple concurrent Claude sessions

**Problem**: The v1.0 queue format used single `**Owner**:` stamp for entire queue. When Session B started bug-fix-mode while Session A was active, Session B's initialization would overwrite Session A's ownership, causing confusion about which session owns which bugs.

**Solution**: Implemented v2.0 queue format with per-bug ownership:
- Active Sessions table tracks multiple concurrent sessions
- Bugs are claimed (Queued → In Progress) with `| Owner: [id]` tags
- Completed bugs have `| By: [id]` attribution
- Backward compatible: v1.0 queues auto-migrate to v2.0

**Files Modified**:
- `workflow/bug-fix-mode.md` - Major update to v1.4:
  - Step 1: v2.0 format detection and auto-migration
  - Step 3: Renamed to "Register Session" with Active Sessions table
  - Step 5: Added claiming mechanism with ownership conflict detection
  - Step 10: Updated queue format with attribution
  - Step 16: Updated archive logic for session status
  - New section: v2.0 Queue Format Reference
  - Session Isolation Rules: Added bug queue prohibitions
- `CLAUDE.md` (project) - Updated Bug Fix Mode section for v2.0
- `global/CLAUDE.md` - Updated auto-include note for v2.0 format
- `bug-fix-queue.md` - Migrated from v1.0 to v2.0 format
