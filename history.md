# Planning is Prompting - Session History

**RESUME HERE**: Session-end workflow complete. All backup slash commands tested and working. Ready for next session work on remaining TODOs (install workflows in genie-in-the-box, populate workflow stubs, add examples to README).

**Current Status**: Session-start workflow complete, backup workflow with version checking implemented, slash command naming consistency enforced across all workflows.
**Next Steps**: Test backup workflow in practice, install workflows in other repos, continue populating stub workflow files.

### 2025.10.08 - Session 6: Backup Slash Command Testing & Session-End Workflow

**Accomplishments**:
- **Successfully tested all three backup slash commands**:
  - `/plan-backup-check` - Version checking functionality verified ‚úÖ
  - `/plan-backup` - Dry-run preview tested (6 files detected) ‚úÖ
  - `/plan-backup-write` - Write mode executed successfully (28.52K transferred) ‚úÖ
- **Fixed bash bug in backup.sh**:
  - Issue: `local` keyword used outside function (lines 81, 83)
  - Solution: Removed `local` from top-level script variables
  - Result: Version check now works correctly
- **Confirmed autocomplete discovery**:
  - All three commands (`/plan-backup*`) appear in autocomplete after login
  - "Safe Default + Explicit Variants" pattern validated
  - Commands are logically grouped and easily discoverable
- **Executed complete session-end workflow**:
  - Read canonical workflow from planning-is-prompting ‚Üí workflow/session-end.md
  - Created TodoWrite tracking checklist (8 steps)
  - Quick token count: 1,611 words, 2,142 tokens (8.5% of limit, ‚úÖ HEALTHY)
  - Session-end ritual executed as designed

**Key Design Validations**:
- **Autocomplete Pattern**: `/plan-backup*` naming creates discoverable command family
- **Safe Defaults**: Default command is non-destructive (dry-run), destructive operations require explicit intent
- **Version Management**: Automatic version checking working correctly (local v1.0 = canonical v1.0)
- **Reference Wrapper Pattern**: Slash commands successfully read and execute canonical workflows

**Files Modified**:
1. `src/scripts/backup.sh` - Fixed bash error (removed invalid `local` keywords)
2. `history.md` - Updated RESUME HERE and added session summary
3. Synced to backup: 6 files transferred to DATA02

**TODO for Next Session**:
- [ ] Install backup + session workflows in genie-in-the-box repo
- [ ] Populate remaining workflow stubs (commit-management.md, notification-system.md)
- [ ] Add practical examples to README.md
- [ ] Test session-start workflow in another repo
- [ ] Test p-is-p workflows in practice

### 2025.10.08 - Session 5: Session-Start Workflow & Backup Infrastructure

**Accomplishments**:
- **Populated session-start.md workflow** (510 lines):
  - TodoWrite-based initialization checklist (steps 0-6)
  - Configuration loading and validation
  - Workflow discovery and categorization
  - History loading with token health check
  - Outstanding TODO handling (ask user for direction, not auto-carry-forward)
  - Session context presentation with integration to p-is-p workflows
- **Updated INSTALLATION-GUIDE.md naming convention** (v1.1):
  - Changed from target project prefix to source repository prefix
  - All workflows now use `/plan-*` prefix (identifies planning-is-prompting origin)
  - Updated all examples: `/cosa-session-end` ‚Üí `/plan-session-end` pattern
  - Rationale: Prefix shows provenance/source, not target project
- **Created comprehensive backup workflow with runtime version checking**:
  - Canonical script: `scripts/rsync-backup.sh` v1.0 (185 lines)
  - Exclusion template: `scripts/rsync-exclude-default.txt`
  - Slash command template: `scripts/backup-command-template.md`
  - Version check workflow: `workflow/backup-version-check.md` (460 lines)
  - Smart update mechanism preserves config, merges exclusions
  - Environment-driven: Uses `$PLANNING_IS_PROMPTING_ROOT`
  - Added to global/CLAUDE.md: PLANNING_IS_PROMPTING_ROOT env var
  - Installation section in INSTALLATION-GUIDE.md (290 lines)
- **Fixed backup slash command naming consistency**:
  - Renamed `.claude/commands/backup.md` ‚Üí `plan-backup.md`
  - Updated all documentation: `/backup` ‚Üí `/plan-backup` (30+ instances)
  - Files updated: template, canonical script, version check workflow, installation guide
  - Now consistent with `/plan-session-end`, `/plan-history-management`, `/plan-session-start`
- **Dogfooding installations** (testing in this repo):
  - Installed backup.sh in src/scripts/ (customized for planning-is-prompting)
  - Installed /plan-backup slash command
  - Installed session-start workflow content

**Key Design Decisions**:
- **Session-start pattern**: Initialization steps become TodoWrite checklist for visual progress
- **Outstanding TODOs**: Notification + user prompt [1/2/3], not automatic carry-forward
- **Backup architecture**: Copy pattern (independent repos) + version checking (update discovery)
- **Version checking**: Automatic on every run, offers smart updates that preserve config
- **Slash command provenance**: `/plan-*` prefix identifies source repository across all projects
- **Environment configuration**: PLANNING_IS_PROMPTING_ROOT for canonical script location

**Accomplishments Summary**:
- 3 major workflow files created/populated (~1,260 total lines)
- 8 files updated for naming consistency
- Environment configuration established
- Complete backup infrastructure with version management

**TODO for Next Session**:
- [ ] Test backup workflow: Run /plan-backup in this repo
- [ ] Test session-start workflow: Run /plan-session-start
- [ ] Install backup + session workflows in genie-in-the-box repo
- [ ] Populate remaining workflow stubs (commit-management.md, notification-system.md)
- [ ] Add practical examples to README.md

### 2025.10.04 - Session 4: Planning is Prompting Core Workflows & Naming System

**Accomplishments**:
- **Created comprehensive "Planning is Prompting" workflow system** (the heart of this repository):
  - `p-is-p-00-start-here.md` (400 lines) - Entry point with philosophy, decision matrix, quick start guide
  - `p-is-p-01-planning-the-work.md` (930 lines) - Work planning workflow (discovery ‚Üí pattern ‚Üí breakdown ‚Üí TodoWrite)
  - `p-is-p-02-documenting-the-implementation.md` (650 lines) - Implementation documentation for large projects
- **Renamed core workflows** with p-is-p-* prefix for logical grouping:
  - `work-planning.md` ‚Üí `p-is-p-01-planning-the-work.md`
  - `implementation-documentation.md` ‚Üí `p-is-p-02-documenting-the-implementation.md`
- **Created global config snapshot**: Copied `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` ‚Üí `global/CLAUDE.md` as reference template
- **Created three thin wrapper slash commands** (~40-50 lines each):
  - `.claude/commands/p-is-p-00-start-here.md` - Entry point wrapper
  - `.claude/commands/p-is-p-01-planning.md` - Work planning wrapper
  - `.claude/commands/p-is-p-02-documentation.md` - Implementation docs wrapper
  - All follow reference wrapper pattern (read canonical, don't duplicate content)
- **Updated INSTALLATION-GUIDE.md**: Added "Planning is Prompting Core Workflows" section with decision matrix
- **Updated README.md**: Featured decision matrix and p-is-p workflows prominently at top
- **Updated repo CLAUDE.md**: Added dogfooding examples showing how this repo uses its own workflows

**Key Design Decisions**:
- **"Planning is Prompting" philosophy**: Structure IS the prompt - organized plans create shared mental models
- **Two-step process**: Step 1 (planning) always required, Step 2 (implementation docs) conditional based on pattern
- **Five planning patterns**: Multi-Phase Implementation, Research & Exploration, Feature Development, Problem Investigation, Architecture & Design
- **Decision matrix**: Clear rules for when to use each workflow (duration, complexity, phases)
- **p-is-p-* naming convention**: Groups core workflows together in file system, scalable (00, 01, 02...)
- **Thin wrapper slash commands**: Avoid content duplication - just read and execute canonical workflows
- **Pattern-driven approach**: Let work characteristics determine structure, not intuition

**Pattern Used This Session**:
- Work type: Feature Development (creating new workflow system)
- Scale: Medium (2 hours)
- Pattern: Pattern 3 (Feature Development)
- Documentation: history.md only (no dedicated implementation docs needed)

**TODO for Next Session**:
- [ ] Test `/p-is-p-00-start-here` workflow in practice
- [ ] Test `/p-is-p-01-planning` with different patterns
- [ ] Demonstrate p-is-p workflows in another repo
- [ ] Populate remaining workflow stub files (commit-management.md, notification-system.md, session-start.md)
- [ ] Add example inputs/outputs to README.md

### 2025.10.03 - Session 3: Token Counter Script & Auto-Approval Integration

**Accomplishments**:
- Created `/home/rruiz/.claude/scripts/get-token-count.sh` - unified word count + token calculation script
- Script features:
  - Combines word counting and token estimation (words √ó 1.33) in single command
  - Displays word count, estimated tokens, percentage of 25k limit
  - Color-coded health indicators (‚úÖ HEALTHY / ‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING / üö® CRITICAL)
  - Made executable and tested successfully (756 tokens, 3.0% of limit)
- Added script to auto-approved commands in `~/.claude/settings.local.json`
  - Pattern: `Bash(/home/rruiz/.claude/scripts/get-token-count.sh:*)`
  - Enables automatic execution during workflows without permission prompts
- Updated `workflow/session-end.md`:
  - Added new "0.4) Quick Token Count Check (Manual)" section
  - Documented usage, output format, status indicators, and when to use vs. full health check
  - Positioned before automated health check section (0.5)
- Updated `workflow/history-management.md`:
  - Revised "Maintenance Commands ‚Üí Check Token Count" section
  - Listed new script as recommended method with full details
  - Positioned as lightweight alternative to full `/history-management mode=check`
- Executed `/plan-session-end` slash command - first test of reference wrapper pattern

**Key Design Decisions**:
- Single unified script better than two separate scripts (count-words.sh + calculate-tokens.sh)
- Pre-approval in settings.local.json enables seamless workflow automation
- Quick script check vs. full health check: offer both options for different use cases
- Script shows health status to guide decision-making without full velocity analysis

**TODO for Next Session**:
- [ ] Populate remaining workflow stub files (work-planning.md, commit-management.md, notification-system.md, session-start.md)
- [ ] Add example inputs/outputs to README.md
- [ ] Demonstrate workflow installation in another repo
- [ ] Test all three slash commands across multiple sessions

### 2025.10.01 - Session 2: CLAUDE.md, Installation Guide & Self-Management

**Accomplishments**:
- Created `CLAUDE.md` for this repository with portable path references
- Updated `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` to use portable format (planning-is-prompting ‚Üí workflow/...)
- **Modernized global config for Plan Mode**: Removed obsolete "consult first" instruction, streamlined session workflows
- Replaced hardcoded `[PLAN]` with `[SHORT_PROJECT_PREFIX]` in workflow/session-end.md (13 occurrences)
- Created comprehensive `workflow/INSTALLATION-GUIDE.md` (436 lines) with:
  - Slash command naming convention (`/<lowercase-prefix>-<workflow-name>`)
  - Installation prompts for all workflows
  - Session-End, History Management, Session-Start, Work Planning, Notifications, Commit Management sections
- Simplified History Management section using reference wrapper pattern (reduced ~90 lines)
- Created `.claude/commands/` directory with three slash commands:
  - `plan-history-management.md` - 4 modes (check/archive/analyze/dry-run)
  - `plan-session-end.md` - Complete session-end ritual
  - `plan-session-start.md` - Session initialization
- All slash commands follow reference wrapper pattern (read canonical doc on every invocation)
- **Synchronized template**: Updated `workflow/claude-config-global.md` to match modernized global config
- Successfully tested session-end workflow execution from slash command

**Key Design Decisions**:
- Use `[SHORT_PROJECT_PREFIX]` placeholder for reusability across projects
- Slash command naming: `/<lowercase-prefix>-<workflow-name>` prevents multi-repo conflicts
- **Reference wrapper pattern**: Slash commands read canonical docs on each invocation (true reuse, not duplication)
- Self-management: This repo uses its own workflows (dogfooding)
- Installation guide eliminates duplication - all implementation details stay in canonical docs

**TODO for Next Session**:
- [ ] Test `/plan-session-end`, `/plan-history-management`, `/plan-session-start` slash commands
- [ ] Populate content in remaining workflow stub files (work-planning.md, commit-management.md, notification-system.md, session-start.md)
- [ ] Add example inputs/outputs to README.md
- [ ] Demonstrate workflow installation in another repo
