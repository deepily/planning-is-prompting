### 2025.10.04 - Session 4: Planning is Prompting Core Workflows & Naming System

**Accomplishments**:
- **Created comprehensive "Planning is Prompting" workflow system** (the heart of this repository):
  - `p-is-p-00-start-here.md` (400 lines) - Entry point with philosophy, decision matrix, quick start guide
  - `p-is-p-01-planning-the-work.md` (930 lines) - Work planning workflow (discovery ‚Üí pattern ‚Üí breakdown ‚Üí TodoWrite)
  - `p-is-p-02-documenting-the-implementation.md` (650 lines) - Implementation documentation for large projects
- **Renamed core workflows** with p-is-p-* prefix for logical grouping:
  - `work-planning.md` ‚Üí `p-is-p-01-planning-the-work.md`
  - `implementation-documentation.md` ‚Üí `p-is-p-02-documenting-the-implementation.md`
- **Created global config snapshot**: Copied `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` ‚Üí `global/CLAUDE.md` as reference template
- **Created three thin wrapper slash commands** (~40-50 lines each):
  - `.claude/commands/p-is-p-00-start-here.md` - Entry point wrapper
  - `.claude/commands/p-is-p-01-planning.md` - Work planning wrapper
  - `.claude/commands/p-is-p-02-documentation.md` - Implementation docs wrapper
  - All follow reference wrapper pattern (read canonical, don't duplicate content)
- **Updated INSTALLATION-GUIDE.md**: Added "Planning is Prompting Core Workflows" section with decision matrix
- **Updated README.md**: Featured decision matrix and p-is-p workflows prominently at top
- **Updated repo CLAUDE.md**: Added dogfooding examples showing how this repo uses its own workflows

**Key Design Decisions**:
- **"Planning is Prompting" philosophy**: Structure IS the prompt - organized plans create shared mental models
- **Two-step process**: Step 1 (planning) always required, Step 2 (implementation docs) conditional based on pattern
- **Five planning patterns**: Multi-Phase Implementation, Research & Exploration, Feature Development, Problem Investigation, Architecture & Design
- **Decision matrix**: Clear rules for when to use each workflow (duration, complexity, phases)
- **p-is-p-* naming convention**: Groups core workflows together in file system, scalable (00, 01, 02...)
- **Thin wrapper slash commands**: Avoid content duplication - just read and execute canonical workflows
- **Pattern-driven approach**: Let work characteristics determine structure, not intuition

**Pattern Used This Session**:
- Work type: Feature Development (creating new workflow system)
- Scale: Medium (2 hours)
- Pattern: Pattern 3 (Feature Development)
- Documentation: history.md only (no dedicated implementation docs needed)

**TODO for Next Session**:
- [ ] Test `/p-is-p-00-start-here` workflow in practice
- [ ] Test `/p-is-p-01-planning` with different patterns
- [ ] Demonstrate p-is-p workflows in another repo
- [ ] Populate remaining workflow stub files (commit-management.md, notification-system.md, session-start.md)
- [ ] Add example inputs/outputs to README.md

### 2025.10.03 - Session 3: Token Counter Script & Auto-Approval Integration

**Accomplishments**:
- Created `/home/rruiz/.claude/scripts/get-token-count.sh` - unified word count + token calculation script
- Script features:
  - Combines word counting and token estimation (words √ó 1.33) in single command
  - Displays word count, estimated tokens, percentage of 25k limit
  - Color-coded health indicators (‚úÖ HEALTHY / ‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING / üö® CRITICAL)
  - Made executable and tested successfully (756 tokens, 3.0% of limit)
- Added script to auto-approved commands in `~/.claude/settings.local.json`
  - Pattern: `Bash(/home/rruiz/.claude/scripts/get-token-count.sh:*)`
  - Enables automatic execution during workflows without permission prompts
- Updated `workflow/session-end.md`:
  - Added new "0.4) Quick Token Count Check (Manual)" section
  - Documented usage, output format, status indicators, and when to use vs. full health check
  - Positioned before automated health check section (0.5)
- Updated `workflow/history-management.md`:
  - Revised "Maintenance Commands ‚Üí Check Token Count" section
  - Listed new script as recommended method with full details
  - Positioned as lightweight alternative to full `/history-management mode=check`
- Executed `/plan-session-end` slash command - first test of reference wrapper pattern

**Key Design Decisions**:
- Single unified script better than two separate scripts (count-words.sh + calculate-tokens.sh)
- Pre-approval in settings.local.json enables seamless workflow automation
- Quick script check vs. full health check: offer both options for different use cases
- Script shows health status to guide decision-making without full velocity analysis

**TODO for Next Session**:
- [ ] Populate remaining workflow stub files (work-planning.md, commit-management.md, notification-system.md, session-start.md)
- [ ] Add example inputs/outputs to README.md
- [ ] Demonstrate workflow installation in another repo
- [ ] Test all three slash commands across multiple sessions

### 2025.10.01 - Session 2: CLAUDE.md, Installation Guide & Self-Management

**Accomplishments**:
- Created `CLAUDE.md` for this repository with portable path references
- Updated `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` to use portable format (planning-is-prompting ‚Üí workflow/...)
- **Modernized global config for Plan Mode**: Removed obsolete "consult first" instruction, streamlined session workflows
- Replaced hardcoded `[PLAN]` with `[SHORT_PROJECT_PREFIX]` in workflow/session-end.md (13 occurrences)
- Created comprehensive `workflow/INSTALLATION-GUIDE.md` (436 lines) with:
  - Slash command naming convention (`/<lowercase-prefix>-<workflow-name>`)
  - Installation prompts for all workflows
  - Session-End, History Management, Session-Start, Work Planning, Notifications, Commit Management sections
- Simplified History Management section using reference wrapper pattern (reduced ~90 lines)
- Created `.claude/commands/` directory with three slash commands:
  - `plan-history-management.md` - 4 modes (check/archive/analyze/dry-run)
  - `plan-session-end.md` - Complete session-end ritual
  - `plan-session-start.md` - Session initialization
- All slash commands follow reference wrapper pattern (read canonical doc on every invocation)
- **Synchronized template**: Updated `workflow/claude-config-global.md` to match modernized global config
- Successfully tested session-end workflow execution from slash command

**Key Design Decisions**:
- Use `[SHORT_PROJECT_PREFIX]` placeholder for reusability across projects
- Slash command naming: `/<lowercase-prefix>-<workflow-name>` prevents multi-repo conflicts
- **Reference wrapper pattern**: Slash commands read canonical docs on each invocation (true reuse, not duplication)
- Self-management: This repo uses its own workflows (dogfooding)
- Installation guide eliminates duplication - all implementation details stay in canonical docs

**TODO for Next Session**:
- [ ] Test `/plan-session-end`, `/plan-history-management`, `/plan-session-start` slash commands
- [ ] Populate content in remaining workflow stub files (work-planning.md, commit-management.md, notification-system.md, session-start.md)
- [ ] Add example inputs/outputs to README.md
- [ ] Demonstrate workflow installation in another repo

## September 2025

### 2025.09.30 - Session 1: Initial Repository Setup & Workflow Structure

**Accomplishments**:
- Fixed typo in README.md ( "Kodex" ‚Üí "Codex" )
- Created `.gitignore` file for Python project ( .venv/, .claude/, .idea/, Python cache )
- Renamed `rnd/` directory to `workflow/` for better clarity
- Created workflow skeleton files:
  - `claude-config-global.md` - Global configuration template
  - `claude-config-local.md` - Project-specific configuration template
  - `session-start.md` - Session initialization prompts
  - `session-end.md` - Session wrap-up workflow
  - `history-management.md` - History management workflow
  - `work-planning.md` - Task planning prompts
  - `commit-management.md` - Git workflow prompts
  - `notification-system.md` - Notification usage prompts
- Updated root `README.md` with comprehensive workflow structure and links
- Populated `claude-config-global.md` with complete contents from `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`
- Condensed history management section in global config to reference canonical workflow
- Fixed path reference to use portable format: "See planning-is-prompting repo ‚Üí workflow/history-management.md"
- Streamlined session-end.md by removing redundant history management details and referencing canonical document
- **Tested session-end workflow** by reading and executing the document

**Key Design Decisions**:
- Organize by workflow phase ( session-start, planning, history, session-end ) not by tool
- Use separate files for each workflow modality
- Keep concise quick-reference in global config, detailed canonical versions in workflow files
- Single README.md in root ( no separate workflow README )
- Reference canonical workflows using portable "See repo ‚Üí path" format

**TODO for Next Session**:
- [ ] Populate remaining workflow files from existing repos
- [ ] Create local CLAUDE.md template with [SHORT_PROJECT_PREFIX] example
- [ ] Add example inputs/outputs to README.md
- [ ] Test workflow integration across multiple sessions
