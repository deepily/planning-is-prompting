# Planning is Prompting - Session History

**RESUME HERE**: Testing workflows abstraction complete - three canonical workflows created (baseline, remediation, harness-update) with thin wrapper commands. Comprehensive documentation added to installation guide, README, and CLAUDE.md. Ready for cross-project adoption.

**Current Status**: Testing workflows fully implemented with ~2,400 lines of canonical workflow logic (testing-baseline.md ~800 lines, testing-remediation.md ~1,000 lines, testing-harness-update.md ~600 lines). Three dogfooding wrapper commands created. Reduces testing workflow duplication by ~70% across projects. Complete installation documentation added.
**Next Steps**: Test workflows in planning-is-prompting repository, migrate genie-in-the-box ad-hoc commands to use canonical workflows, validate in production environments.

## October 2025

### 2025.10.11 - Session 10: Testing Workflows Abstraction Implementation

**Accomplishments**:
- **Created comprehensive planning document** (src/rnd/2025.10.11-testing-workflows-abstraction.md):
  - Complete implementation blueprint with specifications
  - Analysis of existing test commands in genie-in-the-box (Lupin + COSA)
  - Target architecture and migration strategy
  - Success criteria and timeline estimates
- **Created three canonical testing workflows** (~2,400 total lines):
  - `workflow/testing-baseline.md` (~800 lines) - Pre-change baseline collection with parameterized config
  - `workflow/testing-remediation.md` (~1,000 lines) - Post-change verification with priority-based remediation
  - `workflow/testing-harness-update.md` (~600 lines) - Test maintenance planning with git-based change discovery
- **Created dogfooding wrapper commands** (3 files):
  - `.claude/commands/plan-test-baseline.md` - Documentation validation for this repo
  - `.claude/commands/plan-test-remediation.md` - Comparison analysis with ANALYSIS_ONLY default
  - `.claude/commands/plan-test-harness-update.md` - Doc change analysis and cross-reference checking
- **Updated comprehensive documentation**:
  - `workflow/INSTALLATION-GUIDE.md` - Added Testing Workflows section (~400 lines) with installation, configuration, troubleshooting
  - `README.md` - Added Testing Workflows to Supporting Workflows section with quick usage examples
  - `CLAUDE.md` - Updated repository structure and added Testing Workflows section

**Key Architecture Decisions**:
- **Thin wrapper pattern**: Project-specific slash commands configure and invoke canonical workflows (no logic duplication)
- **Three-workflow integration**: Baseline (before changes) → Remediation (after changes) → Harness Update (test maintenance)
- **Flexible parameterization**: Supports simple projects (single test suite), complex projects (multi-suite), docs projects (validation)
- **Scope support**: FULL/CRITICAL_ONLY/SELECTIVE/ANALYSIS_ONLY remediation modes
- **Standardized paths**: tests/results/logs and tests/results/reports across all projects
- **Priority-based remediation**: CRITICAL (10m)→HIGH (5m)→MEDIUM (2m) time-boxed fixes

**Testing Strategy Encoded**:
- **Baseline workflow**: Pure data collection (zero remediation), establish known-good state, comprehensive reporting
- **Remediation workflow**: Compare vs baseline, identify regressions, systematic fixes in priority order, validation re-testing
- **Harness update workflow**: Git change discovery, component classification, gap analysis, priority-based update plan with templates

**Benefits**:
- **70% code reduction**: From ~2,000 duplicated lines to ~600 canonical + ~100 per project
- **Single source of truth**: Update workflow once → all projects benefit
- **Drop-in infrastructure**: Installation guide provides complete setup instructions
- **Backwards compatible**: Existing ad-hoc commands remain untouched (coexistence strategy)

**Pattern Used This Session**:
- Work type: Major feature development (workflow abstraction system)
- Scale: Large (6 hours estimated, completed in session)
- Pattern: Pattern 3 (Feature Development - well-defined scope)
- Documentation: history.md + planning document in src/rnd/

**Files Created**:
1. `src/rnd/2025.10.11-testing-workflows-abstraction.md` - Planning document (complete blueprint)
2. `workflow/testing-baseline.md` - Canonical baseline workflow (~800 lines)
3. `workflow/testing-remediation.md` - Canonical remediation workflow (~1,000 lines)
4. `workflow/testing-harness-update.md` - Canonical harness update workflow (~600 lines)
5. `.claude/commands/plan-test-baseline.md` - Dogfooding wrapper
6. `.claude/commands/plan-test-remediation.md` - Dogfooding wrapper
7. `.claude/commands/plan-test-harness-update.md` - Dogfooding wrapper

**Files Modified**:
1. `workflow/INSTALLATION-GUIDE.md` - Added Testing Workflows section (~400 lines added)
2. `README.md` - Added Testing Workflows to Supporting Workflows section
3. `CLAUDE.md` - Updated repository structure and added Testing Workflows documentation

**TODO for Next Session**:
- [ ] Test /plan-test-baseline in planning-is-prompting (documentation validation)
- [ ] Test /plan-test-remediation with ANALYSIS_ONLY scope
- [ ] Test /plan-test-harness-update for recent workflow changes
- [ ] Cross-project testing: Install testing workflows in genie-in-the-box
- [ ] Validate configuration examples work correctly
- [ ] Consider creating example project showing all three workflows in action

### 2025.10.11 - Session 9: Installation Wizard Bug Fixes & Enhancements

**Accomplishments**:
- **Fixed three critical UX bugs in installation wizard** (workflow/installation-wizard.md):
  1. **"Press Enter for default" bug**: Changed to 'y' pattern (Enter won't fire on empty input in Claude Code UI)
  2. **Path auto-linking bug**: Wrapped all path values in backticks to prevent markdown URL auto-linking
  3. **Permission prompt fatigue**: Added optional Step 0.5 for one-time auto-approval configuration
- **Added Step 6.5: Verify Git Tracking** (~110 lines):
  - Purpose: Ensure newly created slash commands are tracked by git
  - Checks: `git ls-files .claude/commands/*.md` to verify tracking
  - Diagnostics: Uses `git check-ignore -v` to identify why files aren't tracked
  - Benefits: Prevents silent exclusion, ensures team sharing, provides actionable fix guidance
- **Added Step 8: Offer Session-End Workflow** (~108 lines):
  - Purpose: Allow user to run `/plan-session-end` immediately after installation
  - Conditional: Only offered if `/plan-session-end` was actually installed
  - Process: Checks file existence, presents option, invokes workflow if user accepts
  - Benefits: Immediate documentation, clean git commit, complete end-to-end flow
- **Updated Step 5: .gitignore Pattern**:
  - Changed from excluding only `.claude/settings.local.json` to full pattern
  - New pattern: `.claude/*` with negation exception `!.claude/commands/`
  - Rationale: Ensures slash commands are tracked while excluding user settings
  - Added explanatory rationale text in workflow document
- **Updated Step 0 TODO Template**:
  - Added new steps: "Verify git tracking" and "Offer session-end workflow"
  - Updated both template list and example JSON
  - Ensures installation progress tracking includes all new steps

**Key Design Decisions**:
- **'y' pattern for defaults**: Single character is quick, clear intent ("yes, use default"), works with Claude Code text input
- **Backtick wrapping for paths**: Prevents markdown auto-linking, semantically correct (paths are literal values), maintains copy-paste
- **Git tracking verification**: Catches silent exclusion early, before first commit attempt
- **Conditional session-end offer**: Only shown when relevant (session management installed), avoids confusing planning-only users
- **Optional permission setup**: One-time configuration benefits all future workflow installations in project

**Pattern Used This Session**:
- Work type: Bug fixes and feature enhancements (wizard UX improvements)
- Scale: Medium (1-2 hours)
- Pattern: Pattern 4 (Problem Investigation + fixes)
- Documentation: history.md only

**Files Modified**:
1. `workflow/installation-wizard.md` - Three bug fixes + two new steps + template updates (~340 lines added/modified)

**TODO for Next Session**:
- [ ] Cross-project testing: Install workflows in genie-in-the-box using updated wizard
- [ ] Test new Step 6.5: Verify git tracking verification in action
- [ ] Test new Step 8: Session-end workflow offer flow
- [ ] Validate 'y' pattern for default values works correctly
- [ ] Test clean installation scenario with all new enhancements
- [ ] Update global ~/.claude/CLAUDE.md with new workflow references

### 2025.10.10 - Session 8: Installation Wizard Dogfooding & Validation

**Accomplishments**:
- **Successfully dogfooded INSTALLATION-GUIDE.md**:
  - Executed session-start workflow (/plan-session-start) - all steps validated
  - Shared INSTALLATION-GUIDE.md and triggered installation wizard
  - Wizard correctly detected existing installation (all workflows present)
  - "Add More Workflows" mode validated (correctly showed nothing to add)
  - State detection logic working correctly (clean vs. existing vs. complete)
- **Created /plan-install-wizard slash command**:
  - `.claude/commands/plan-install-wizard.md` (62 lines)
  - Reference wrapper pattern (reads INSTALLATION-GUIDE.md on invocation)
  - Project-agnostic design (works in any project)
  - Optional convenience feature (INSTALLATION-GUIDE.md still works standalone)
- **Updated CLAUDE.md**:
  - Added plan-install-wizard to repository structure diagram
  - Added backup commands (plan-backup-check, plan-backup, plan-backup-write) to structure
  - Created new "Installing Workflows in Other Projects" section
  - Documents wizard usage patterns and benefits
- **Updated README.md**:
  - Added /plan-install-wizard to Quick Install section
  - Documented two installation methods (share guide vs. slash command)
  - Listed all 10 available slash commands with descriptions

**Dogfooding Validation Results**:
1. ✅ Session-start workflow: Executed successfully with TodoWrite tracking
2. ✅ INSTALLATION-GUIDE.md: Executable instructions pattern works
3. ✅ State detection: Correctly identified all installed workflows
4. ✅ "Add More Workflows" mode: Properly shows completion status
5. ✅ Workflow catalog comparison: Accurate detection (0 remaining to install)
6. ✅ /plan-install-wizard creation: File created, reference wrapper pattern validated

**Key Design Validations**:
- **Executable document pattern**: INSTALLATION-GUIDE.md successfully triggers wizard
- **State detection**: Accurately identifies clean/partial/complete installations
- **Reference wrapper pattern**: /plan-install-wizard reads canonical guide (no duplication)
- **Optional convenience**: Wizard works with or without slash command
- **Project-agnostic**: No customization needed for /plan-install-wizard

**Pattern Used This Session**:
- Work type: Testing and validation (dogfooding installation system)
- Scale: Small (1 hour)
- Pattern: Pattern 4 (Investigation/Testing)
- Documentation: history.md only

**Files Created**:
1. `.claude/commands/plan-install-wizard.md` - Installation wizard slash command (62 lines)

**Files Modified**:
1. `CLAUDE.md` - Added wizard reference and updated repository structure
2. `README.md` - Added /plan-install-wizard documentation to Quick Install section

**TODO for Next Session**:
- [ ] Cross-project testing: Install workflows in genie-in-the-box using wizard
- [ ] Test clean installation scenario (in fresh project)
- [ ] Update global ~/.claude/CLAUDE.md with new workflow references
- [ ] Documentation polish: Add more examples to workflows
- [ ] Test session-end workflow in another repo

---

### 2025.10.10 - Session 7: Installation Wizard Implementation

**Accomplishments**:
- **Created comprehensive installation wizard** (1,220 lines):
  - `workflow/installation-wizard.md` - Canonical workflow with complete installation logic
  - Interactive menu system with workflow catalog metadata
  - Smart state detection (clean vs existing installation)
  - "Add More Workflows" mode for existing installations
  - Step 7.5: Optional self-installation of /plan-install-wizard slash command
  - Configuration templates and error handling
- **Updated INSTALLATION-GUIDE.md with executable instruction block** (~108 lines at top):
  - Detects project state (clean or existing workflows)
  - Prompts user with appropriate options
  - Triggers wizard execution based on user choice
  - Manual reference sections remain below (unchanged)
- **Enhanced README.md with Quick Install section**:
  - Prominent 3-step installation process
  - Lists all available workflows
  - Explains optional slash command installation
  - Documents "adding more later" pattern
- **Architecture clarifications through iteration**:
  - Confirmed: No slash command needed in planning-is-prompting repo initially
  - Slash command gets created in target project during Step 7.5 (optional)
  - INSTALLATION-GUIDE.md is primary entry point (always works)
  - Single source of truth: installation-wizard.md (others are thin pointers)

**Key Design Decisions**:
- **Executable document pattern**: INSTALLATION-GUIDE.md contains instructions for Claude to execute wizard
- **No duplication**: Workflow catalog, logic, templates all in installation-wizard.md only
- **Smart detection**: Wizard detects existing installations and offers appropriate options (add more, reinstall, cancel)
- **Optional convenience**: /plan-install-wizard slash command installed only if user opts in (Step 7.5)
- **Bootstrap-friendly**: First use is sharing INSTALLATION-GUIDE.md (no dependencies)
- **Future-proof**: Can always share INSTALLATION-GUIDE.md again to add more workflows

**Pattern Used This Session**:
- Work type: Feature Development (interactive installation system)
- Scale: Medium (2 hours)
- Pattern: Pattern 3 (Feature Development)
- Documentation: history.md only (no dedicated implementation docs needed)

**Files Created**:
1. `workflow/installation-wizard.md` - Canonical installation workflow (1,220 lines)

**Files Modified**:
1. `workflow/INSTALLATION-GUIDE.md` - Added executable instruction block at top
2. `README.md` - Added Quick Install section with installation wizard documentation

**TODO for Next Session**:
- [ ] Test installation wizard: Share INSTALLATION-GUIDE.md in fresh session
- [ ] Dogfood wizard: Validate all steps work correctly (Steps 0-7.5)
- [ ] Verify slash command self-installation works (Step 7.5)
- [ ] Test "Add More Workflows" mode with existing installation
- [ ] Validate configuration collection and file customization
- [ ] Test in genie-in-the-box repo (cross-project validation)

### 2025.10.08 - Session 6: Backup Slash Command Testing & Session-End Workflow

**Accomplishments**:
- **Successfully tested all three backup slash commands**:
  - `/plan-backup-check` - Version checking functionality verified ✅
  - `/plan-backup` - Dry-run preview tested (6 files detected) ✅
  - `/plan-backup-write` - Write mode executed successfully (28.52K transferred) ✅
- **Fixed bash bug in backup.sh**:
  - Issue: `local` keyword used outside function (lines 81, 83)
  - Solution: Removed `local` from top-level script variables
  - Result: Version check now works correctly
- **Confirmed autocomplete discovery**:
  - All three commands (`/plan-backup*`) appear in autocomplete after login
  - "Safe Default + Explicit Variants" pattern validated
  - Commands are logically grouped and easily discoverable
- **Executed complete session-end workflow**:
  - Read canonical workflow from planning-is-prompting → workflow/session-end.md
  - Created TodoWrite tracking checklist (8 steps)
  - Quick token count: 1,611 words, 2,142 tokens (8.5% of limit, ✅ HEALTHY)
  - Session-end ritual executed as designed

**Key Design Validations**:
- **Autocomplete Pattern**: `/plan-backup*` naming creates discoverable command family
- **Safe Defaults**: Default command is non-destructive (dry-run), destructive operations require explicit intent
- **Version Management**: Automatic version checking working correctly (local v1.0 = canonical v1.0)
- **Reference Wrapper Pattern**: Slash commands successfully read and execute canonical workflows

**Files Modified**:
1. `src/scripts/backup.sh` - Fixed bash error (removed invalid `local` keywords)
2. `history.md` - Updated RESUME HERE and added session summary
3. Synced to backup: 6 files transferred to DATA02

**TODO for Next Session**:
- [ ] Install backup + session workflows in genie-in-the-box repo
- [ ] Populate remaining workflow stubs (commit-management.md, notification-system.md)
- [ ] Add practical examples to README.md
- [ ] Test session-start workflow in another repo
- [ ] Test p-is-p workflows in practice

---

### 2025.10.08 - Session 5: Session-Start Workflow & Backup Infrastructure

**Accomplishments**:
- **Populated session-start.md workflow** (510 lines):
  - TodoWrite-based initialization checklist (steps 0-6)
  - Configuration loading and validation
  - Workflow discovery and categorization
  - History loading with token health check
  - Outstanding TODO handling (ask user for direction, not auto-carry-forward)
  - Session context presentation with integration to p-is-p workflows
- **Updated INSTALLATION-GUIDE.md naming convention** (v1.1):
  - Changed from target project prefix to source repository prefix
  - All workflows now use `/plan-*` prefix (identifies planning-is-prompting origin)
  - Updated all examples: `/cosa-session-end` → `/plan-session-end` pattern
  - Rationale: Prefix shows provenance/source, not target project
- **Created comprehensive backup workflow with runtime version checking**:
  - Canonical script: `scripts/rsync-backup.sh` v1.0 (185 lines)
  - Exclusion template: `scripts/rsync-exclude-default.txt`
  - Slash command template: `scripts/backup-command-template.md`
  - Version check workflow: `workflow/backup-version-check.md` (460 lines)
  - Smart update mechanism preserves config, merges exclusions
  - Environment-driven: Uses `$PLANNING_IS_PROMPTING_ROOT`
  - Added to global/CLAUDE.md: PLANNING_IS_PROMPTING_ROOT env var
  - Installation section in INSTALLATION-GUIDE.md (290 lines)
- **Fixed backup slash command naming consistency**:
  - Renamed `.claude/commands/backup.md` → `plan-backup.md`
  - Updated all documentation: `/backup` → `/plan-backup` (30+ instances)
  - Files updated: template, canonical script, version check workflow, installation guide
  - Now consistent with `/plan-session-end`, `/plan-history-management`, `/plan-session-start`
- **Dogfooding installations** (testing in this repo):
  - Installed backup.sh in src/scripts/ (customized for planning-is-prompting)
  - Installed /plan-backup slash command
  - Installed session-start workflow content

**Key Design Decisions**:
- **Session-start pattern**: Initialization steps become TodoWrite checklist for visual progress
- **Outstanding TODOs**: Notification + user prompt [1/2/3], not automatic carry-forward
- **Backup architecture**: Copy pattern (independent repos) + version checking (update discovery)
- **Version checking**: Automatic on every run, offers smart updates that preserve config
- **Slash command provenance**: `/plan-*` prefix identifies source repository across all projects
- **Environment configuration**: PLANNING_IS_PROMPTING_ROOT for canonical script location

**Accomplishments Summary**:
- 3 major workflow files created/populated (~1,260 total lines)
- 8 files updated for naming consistency
- Environment configuration established
- Complete backup infrastructure with version management

**TODO for Next Session**:
- [ ] Test backup workflow: Run /plan-backup in this repo
- [ ] Test session-start workflow: Run /plan-session-start
- [ ] Install backup + session workflows in genie-in-the-box repo
- [ ] Populate remaining workflow stubs (commit-management.md, notification-system.md)
- [ ] Add practical examples to README.md

### 2025.10.04 - Session 4: Planning is Prompting Core Workflows & Naming System

**Accomplishments**:
- **Created comprehensive "Planning is Prompting" workflow system** (the heart of this repository):
  - `p-is-p-00-start-here.md` (400 lines) - Entry point with philosophy, decision matrix, quick start guide
  - `p-is-p-01-planning-the-work.md` (930 lines) - Work planning workflow (discovery → pattern → breakdown → TodoWrite)
  - `p-is-p-02-documenting-the-implementation.md` (650 lines) - Implementation documentation for large projects
- **Renamed core workflows** with p-is-p-* prefix for logical grouping:
  - `work-planning.md` → `p-is-p-01-planning-the-work.md`
  - `implementation-documentation.md` → `p-is-p-02-documenting-the-implementation.md`
- **Created global config snapshot**: Copied `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` → `global/CLAUDE.md` as reference template
- **Created three thin wrapper slash commands** (~40-50 lines each):
  - `.claude/commands/p-is-p-00-start-here.md` - Entry point wrapper
  - `.claude/commands/p-is-p-01-planning.md` - Work planning wrapper
  - `.claude/commands/p-is-p-02-documentation.md` - Implementation docs wrapper
  - All follow reference wrapper pattern (read canonical, don't duplicate content)
- **Updated INSTALLATION-GUIDE.md**: Added "Planning is Prompting Core Workflows" section with decision matrix
- **Updated README.md**: Featured decision matrix and p-is-p workflows prominently at top
- **Updated repo CLAUDE.md**: Added dogfooding examples showing how this repo uses its own workflows

**Key Design Decisions**:
- **"Planning is Prompting" philosophy**: Structure IS the prompt - organized plans create shared mental models
- **Two-step process**: Step 1 (planning) always required, Step 2 (implementation docs) conditional based on pattern
- **Five planning patterns**: Multi-Phase Implementation, Research & Exploration, Feature Development, Problem Investigation, Architecture & Design
- **Decision matrix**: Clear rules for when to use each workflow (duration, complexity, phases)
- **p-is-p-* naming convention**: Groups core workflows together in file system, scalable (00, 01, 02...)
- **Thin wrapper slash commands**: Avoid content duplication - just read and execute canonical workflows
- **Pattern-driven approach**: Let work characteristics determine structure, not intuition

**Pattern Used This Session**:
- Work type: Feature Development (creating new workflow system)
- Scale: Medium (2 hours)
- Pattern: Pattern 3 (Feature Development)
- Documentation: history.md only (no dedicated implementation docs needed)

**TODO for Next Session**:
- [ ] Test `/p-is-p-00-start-here` workflow in practice
- [ ] Test `/p-is-p-01-planning` with different patterns
- [ ] Demonstrate p-is-p workflows in another repo
- [ ] Populate remaining workflow stub files (commit-management.md, notification-system.md, session-start.md)
- [ ] Add example inputs/outputs to README.md

---

### 2025.10.03 - Session 3: Token Counter Script & Auto-Approval Integration

**Accomplishments**:
- Created `/home/rruiz/.claude/scripts/get-token-count.sh` - unified word count + token calculation script
- Script features:
  - Combines word counting and token estimation (words × 1.33) in single command
  - Displays word count, estimated tokens, percentage of 25k limit
  - Color-coded health indicators (✅ HEALTHY / ⚠️ WARNING / 🚨 CRITICAL)
  - Made executable and tested successfully (756 tokens, 3.0% of limit)
- Added script to auto-approved commands in `~/.claude/settings.local.json`
  - Pattern: `Bash(/home/rruiz/.claude/scripts/get-token-count.sh:*)`
  - Enables automatic execution during workflows without permission prompts
- Updated `workflow/session-end.md`:
  - Added new "0.4) Quick Token Count Check (Manual)" section
  - Documented usage, output format, status indicators, and when to use vs. full health check
  - Positioned before automated health check section (0.5)
- Updated `workflow/history-management.md`:
  - Revised "Maintenance Commands → Check Token Count" section
  - Listed new script as recommended method with full details
  - Positioned as lightweight alternative to full `/history-management mode=check`
- Executed `/plan-session-end` slash command - first test of reference wrapper pattern

**Key Design Decisions**:
- Single unified script better than two separate scripts (count-words.sh + calculate-tokens.sh)
- Pre-approval in settings.local.json enables seamless workflow automation
- Quick script check vs. full health check: offer both options for different use cases
- Script shows health status to guide decision-making without full velocity analysis

**TODO for Next Session**:
- [ ] Populate remaining workflow stub files (work-planning.md, commit-management.md, notification-system.md, session-start.md)
- [ ] Add example inputs/outputs to README.md
- [ ] Demonstrate workflow installation in another repo
- [ ] Test all three slash commands across multiple sessions

---

### 2025.10.01 - Session 2: CLAUDE.md, Installation Guide & Self-Management

**Accomplishments**:
- Created `CLAUDE.md` for this repository with portable path references
- Updated `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` to use portable format (planning-is-prompting → workflow/...)
- **Modernized global config for Plan Mode**: Removed obsolete "consult first" instruction, streamlined session workflows
- Replaced hardcoded `[PLAN]` with `[SHORT_PROJECT_PREFIX]` in workflow/session-end.md (13 occurrences)
- Created comprehensive `workflow/INSTALLATION-GUIDE.md` (436 lines) with:
  - Slash command naming convention (`/<lowercase-prefix>-<workflow-name>`)
  - Installation prompts for all workflows
  - Session-End, History Management, Session-Start, Work Planning, Notifications, Commit Management sections
- Simplified History Management section using reference wrapper pattern (reduced ~90 lines)
- Created `.claude/commands/` directory with three slash commands:
  - `plan-history-management.md` - 4 modes (check/archive/analyze/dry-run)
  - `plan-session-end.md` - Complete session-end ritual
  - `plan-session-start.md` - Session initialization
- All slash commands follow reference wrapper pattern (read canonical doc on every invocation)
- **Synchronized template**: Updated `workflow/claude-config-global.md` to match modernized global config
- Successfully tested session-end workflow execution from slash command

**Key Design Decisions**:
- Use `[SHORT_PROJECT_PREFIX]` placeholder for reusability across projects
- Slash command naming: `/<lowercase-prefix>-<workflow-name>` prevents multi-repo conflicts
- **Reference wrapper pattern**: Slash commands read canonical docs on each invocation (true reuse, not duplication)
- Self-management: This repo uses its own workflows (dogfooding)
- Installation guide eliminates duplication - all implementation details stay in canonical docs

**TODO for Next Session**:
- [ ] Test `/plan-session-end`, `/plan-history-management`, `/plan-session-start` slash commands
- [ ] Populate content in remaining workflow stub files (work-planning.md, commit-management.md, notification-system.md, session-start.md)
- [ ] Add example inputs/outputs to README.md
- [ ] Demonstrate workflow installation in another repo

## September 2025

### 2025.09.30 - Session 1: Initial Repository Setup & Workflow Structure

**Accomplishments**:
- Fixed typo in README.md ( "Kodex" → "Codex" )
- Created `.gitignore` file for Python project ( .venv/, .claude/, .idea/, Python cache )
- Renamed `rnd/` directory to `workflow/` for better clarity
- Created workflow skeleton files:
  - `claude-config-global.md` - Global configuration template
  - `claude-config-local.md` - Project-specific configuration template
  - `session-start.md` - Session initialization prompts
  - `session-end.md` - Session wrap-up workflow

- Fixed path reference to use portable format: "See planning-is-prompting repo → workflow/history-management.md"
- Streamlined session-end.md by removing redundant history management details and referencing canonical document
- **Tested session-end workflow** by reading and executing the document

**Key Design Decisions**:
- Organize by workflow phase ( session-start, planning, history, session-end ) not by tool
- Use separate files for each workflow modality
- Keep concise quick-reference in global config, detailed canonical versions in workflow files
- Single README.md in root ( no separate workflow README )
