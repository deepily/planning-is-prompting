## September 2025

### 2025.09.30 - Session 1: Initial Repository Setup & Workflow Structure

**Accomplishments**:
- Created initial repository structure for planning-is-prompting meta-project
- Established README.md with project overview and core concepts
- Created global/CLAUDE.md template (for ~/.claude/CLAUDE.md)
- Created workflow/ directory for canonical workflow documents
- Defined repository purpose: meta-knowledge base for Claude Code workflow patterns
- Established naming conventions: workflow templates use `topic-name.md` format

**Initial Structure**:
```
planning-is-prompting/
├── workflow/          # Canonical workflow templates
├── global/            # Global config snapshot
├── README.md          # Repository overview
└── history.md         # Session history (this file)
```

**Key Decisions**:
- **Meta-repository approach**: No executable code, only documentation and templates
- **Canonical workflow pattern**: workflow/ contains authoritative documents, slash commands reference them
- **Two-tier config system**: Global (~/.claude/CLAUDE.md) + Local (<project>/CLAUDE.md)
- **History management**: Use history.md for session tracking with reverse chronological order

**Pattern Used**: Pattern 1 (Multi-Phase Project - initialization phase)

**Files Created**:
1. `README.md` - Repository overview and documentation
2. `global/CLAUDE.md` - Global configuration template
3. `workflow/` - Directory for canonical workflows
4. `history.md` - Session tracking document

---

### 2025.10.01 - Session 2: CLAUDE.md, Installation Guide & Self-Management

**Accomplishments**:
- Created comprehensive CLAUDE.md template for project-level configuration
- Created workflow/INSTALLATION-GUIDE.md with manual installation instructions
- Established self-dogfooding principle: planning-is-prompting uses its own workflows
- Defined workflow reference pattern: "planning-is-prompting → workflow/filename.md"
- Created initial history.md structure with date format yyyy.mm.dd

**Key Patterns Established**:
- **Self-management**: Repository uses its own session management and history workflows
- **Canonical references**: Projects reference workflows by path, not by copying
- **Template portability**: Templates use placeholders for project-specific customization

**Files Created**:
1. `CLAUDE.md` - Project-specific configuration template
2. `workflow/INSTALLATION-GUIDE.md` - Manual installation instructions
3. Updated `history.md` - Added session tracking structure

**Decision**: Keep templates generalizable - use `[PROJECT]`, `[SHORT_PROJECT_PREFIX]`, `/path/to/project/` placeholders

---

### 2025.10.03 - Session 3: Token Counter Script & Auto-Approval Integration

**Accomplishments**:
- Created ~/.claude/scripts/get-token-count.sh for quick history.md health checks
- Integrated script into global CLAUDE.md as pre-approved command
- Established token health indicators: ✅ HEALTHY (<20k), ⚠️ WARNING (20-22k), 🚨 CRITICAL (>22k)
- Defined 25,000 token limit for history.md files
- Created workflow for archival when approaching limits

**Token Health System**:
```bash
~/.claude/scripts/get-token-count.sh /path/to/history.md
# Output:
# Words: 4,597
# Tokens: 6,115 (estimated)
# Status: 24.5% of 25,000 token limit
# Health: ✅ HEALTHY
```

**Key Decisions**:
- **Word count × 1.33** = token approximation (fast, no API calls)
- **Pre-approved script**: No permission prompts during session-end workflows
- **Health thresholds**: 20k warning, 22k critical, 25k hard limit

**Files Created**:
1. `~/.claude/scripts/get-token-count.sh` - Token counter utility
2. Updated global CLAUDE.md with script approval configuration

### 2025.10.04 - Session 4: Planning is Prompting Core Workflows & Naming System

**Accomplishments**:
- **Created Planning is Prompting (p-is-p) three-workflow system**:
  - `/p-is-p-00-start-here` - Entry point with decision matrix and philosophy
  - `/p-is-p-01-planning` - Work planning workflow (classify → pattern → breakdown)
  - `/p-is-p-02-documentation` - Implementation documentation (for large/complex work)
- **Established naming convention**:
  - `plan-*` for project management workflows (session, history, backup)
  - `p-is-p-*` for Planning is Prompting core workflows
- **Defined six planning patterns**:
  - Pattern 1: Multi-Phase Projects (4+ weeks)
  - Pattern 2: Research & Documentation (1-2 weeks)
  - Pattern 3: Feature Development (1-3 days)
  - Pattern 4: Bug Investigation & Resolution (hours)
  - Pattern 5: System Architecture & Design (1-2 weeks)
  - Pattern 6: Research-Driven Implementation (2-4 weeks)

**Key Workflow Features**:
- **Decision matrix**: Helps classify work type and select appropriate pattern
- **Pattern-based breakdown**: Each pattern has specific phase structure
- **Conditional documentation**: Step 2 only for large projects (Patterns 1, 2, 5, 6)
- **TodoWrite integration**: All workflows create tracking lists

**Files Created**:
1. `workflow/p-is-p-00-start-here.md` - Entry point and decision matrix
2. `workflow/p-is-p-01-planning.md` - Work planning workflow
3. `workflow/p-is-p-02-documentation.md` - Implementation docs workflow
4. `.claude/commands/p-is-p-00-start-here.md` - Slash command wrapper
5. `.claude/commands/p-is-p-01-planning.md` - Slash command wrapper
6. `.claude/commands/p-is-p-02-documentation.md` - Slash command wrapper

**Design Insight**: Two-step process (planning → documentation) scales from small to large work

  - Tier 2: Organized smoke tests (src/tests/smoke/)
- Created smoke test template with cu.print_banner() formatting
- Documented progressive adoption pattern (smoke → unit → integration)

**Smoke Test Pattern**:
```python
def quick_smoke_test():
    """Quick smoke test for ModuleName - validates basic functionality."""
    import cosa.utils.util as cu

    cu.print_banner("ModuleName Smoke Test", prepend_nl=True)

    try:
        # Test 1: Module loads
        print("Testing module import...")
        from module_name import SomeClass
        print("✓ Module imported successfully")

        # Test 2: Core workflow executes
        print("Testing core workflow...")
        obj = SomeClass(debug=True)
        result = obj.do_something()
        assert result is not None
        print(f"✓ Core workflow executed: {result}")

        print("\n✓ Smoke test completed successfully")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"\n✗ Smoke test failed: {e}")
        import traceback
        traceback.print_exc()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    quick_smoke_test()
```

**Files Modified**:

- Identified "Interactive Discovery" pattern emerging from user interactions
- Observed two key behaviors:
  - Clarifying follow-up questions when requirements vague
  - Topic list with candidate answers for efficiency
- Discussed terminology: "Interactive Requirements Elicitation with Smart Defaults"
- Planned formalization for next session (add to global CLAUDE.md + p-is-p-00-start-here.md)

**Key Elements Identified**:
- **Proactive detection**: Vague phrasing, short descriptions, exploratory language
- **Socratic questioning**: Scope, timeline, constraints, outcomes
- **Smart defaults**: Combine historical patterns (from history.md) + best practices
- **Topic tracking**: Visual progress indicator (✓ complete, ~ partial, ○ not discussed)
- **Explicit transition**: Ask before invoking /p-is-p-01-planning

**Decision**: Insert as "Pre-Planning" phase before formal workflow invocation, not as Phase 0 of planning
